            "\n",
            "1. Recognition: Healthcare professionals must identify sepsis early and assess its severity using scoring systems like the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score or the Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Fluid resuscitation: The first step in managing sepsis is to restore intravascular volume by administering fluids intravenously. This helps maintain adequate blood pressure and organ perfusion.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Antibiotics: Administering antibiotics as soon as possible is crucial for treating the underlying infection. The choice of antibiotics depends on the suspected infection source and the patient's allergies.\n",

            "4. Vasopressors: If the patient's blood pressure remains low despite fluid resuscitation, vasopressors may be needed to maintain adequate blood pressure.\n",

            "6. Source control: Addressing the source of the infection is essential for effective sepsis management. This may involve surgical intervention, such as drainage of an abscess or removal of a catheter.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. Monitoring: Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory values, and organ function is necessary to assess the patient's response to treatment and make any necessary adjustments.\n",

Hypothyroidism may follow.\\nDrug-induced hyperthyroidism can result from amiodarone and interferon alfa, which may induce\\nthyroiditis with hyperthyroidism and other thyroid disorders. Although more commonly causing\\nhypothyroidism, lithium can rarely cause hyperthyroidism. Patients receiving these drugs should be\\nclosely monitored.\\nThyrotoxicosis factitia is hyperthyroidism resulting from conscious or accidental overingestion of thyroid\\nhormone.\\nExcess iodine ingestion causes hyperthyroidism with a low thyroid radioactive iodine uptake. It most\\noften occurs in patients with underlying nontoxic nodular goiter (especially elderly patients) who are given\\ndrugs that contain iodine (eg, amiodarone, iodine-containing expectorants) or who undergo radiologic\\nstudies using iodine-rich contrast agents. The etiology may be that the excess iodine provides substrate\\nfor functionally autonomous (ie, not under TSH regulation) areas of the thyroid to produce hormone.\\nHyperthyroidism usually persists as long as excess iodine remains in the circulation.\\nMetastatic thyroid cancer is a possible cause. Overproduction of thyroid hormone occurs rarely from\\nfunctioning metastatic follicular carcinoma, especially in pulmonary metastases.\\nStruma ovarii develops when ovarian teratomas contain enough thyroid tissue to cause true\\nhyperthyroidism.

In some patients, only T3 is\\nelevated (T3 toxicosis). T3 toxicosis may occur in any of the usual disorders that cause hyperthyroidism,\\nincluding Graves' disease, multinodular goiter, and the autonomously functioning solitary thyroid nodule. If\\nT3 toxicosis is untreated, the patient usually also develops laboratory abnormalities typical of\\nhyperthyroidism (ie, elevated T4 and 123I uptake). The various forms of thyroiditis commonly have a\\nhyperthyroid phase followed by a hypothyroid phase.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nMost symptoms and signs are the same regardless of the cause. Exceptions include infiltrative\\nophthalmopathy and dermopathy, which occur only in Graves' disease.\\nThe clinical presentation may be dramatic or subtle. A goiter or nodule may be present. Many common\\nsymptoms and signs of hyperthyroidism are similar to those of adrenergic excess, such as nervousness,\\npalpitations, hyperactivity, increased sweating, heat hypersensitivity, fatigue, increased appetite, weight\\nloss, insomnia, weakness, and frequent bowel movements (occasionally diarrhea). Hypomenorrhea may\\nbe present. Signs may include warm, moist skin; tremor; tachycardia; widened pulse pressure; atrial\\nfibrillation; and palpitations.\\nElderly patients, particularly those with toxic nodular goiter, may present atypically (apathetic or masked\\nhyperthyroidism) with symptoms more akin to depression or dementia. Most do not have exophthalmos or\\ntremor. Atrial fibrillation, syncope, altered sensorium, heart failure, and weakness are more likely.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition\\nChapter 93.

Medical websites and journals send daily messages announcing results of the\\nlatest studies. Within minutes, subspecialty data heretofore found only in university libraries can be\\nunearthed, along with a vast array of information from academics, commercial organizations, advocacy\\ngroups, the government, and seemingly anyone with a computer and an internet connection.\\nWhat is the role of a general reference work such as The Merck Manual when seemingly the entire body\\nof medical knowledge is at one's fingertips electronically?

The Manual has always been intended as the first stop on\\nthe road to understanding for readers encountering a topic for the first time or for the first time in a long\\ntime. After digesting a Merck Manual topic, readers will be well prepared to understand and evaluate the\\nwealth of more detailed information available elsewhere.\\nAs it has for over 110 years, The Merck Manual focuses on discussions of specific disorders, organized\\nby organ system or medical specialty. In its structured introductions to medical disorders, The Manual\\nprovides health care practitioners and students with straightforward, practical explanations of \"what to do\"\\nto diagnose and treat those conditions. We discuss when to suspect a disease, the proper sequence of\\nevaluation, and the first-line options for treatment along with selected alternatives. In addition, we provide\\nenough background information on etiology and pathophysiology to ensure comprehension of the\\nmanagement recommendations.\\nThe Manual continues to enhance its accessibility. In addition to having introductory \"nut-shells\" at the\\nbeginning of each disease discussion, we have included bulleted lists in the text whenever possible,\\nincluding at the beginning of diagnosis and treatment discussions.\\nIn the interest of brevity, The Merck Manual has never cited references to the medical literature.\\nNonetheless, readers can be assured that our hundreds of contributors and dozens of peer reviewers are\\npresenting the best current recommendations, soundly based on available evidence.\\nAlthough the printed Merck Manual has long since grown too big to be carried in a lab coat, it has\\nreturned to the pocket as content on many different handheld electronic devices. In addition, The Merck\\nManual continues to be available to all readers free of charge at www.merckmanuals.com. Although our\\nelectronic versions have a currency that a printed product cannot, the book still provides a better in-depth\\nreading experience along with a tactile satisfaction and ease of perusal not possessed by electronic\\ndevices. Undoubtedly this will change as technology advances, but whatever the platform, we will\\ncontinue to strive to keep The Merck Manual as useful as ever.\\nWe thank the numerous contributors who have worked diligently with us to craft this edition, and we hope\\nyou will find it worthy of continued and frequent use. As always, suggestions for improvements will be\\nwarmly welcomed and carefully considered.\\nRobert S. Porter, MD\\nEditor-in-Chief\\nCommitted to Providing Medical Information: Merck and The Merck Manuals', 'Editor-in-Chief\\nCommitted to Providing Medical Information: Merck and The Merck Manuals\\nIn 1899, the American drug manufacturer Merck & Co. first published a small book titled Merck\\'s Manual\\nof the Materia Medica. It was meant as an aid to physicians and pharmacists, reminding doctors that\\n\"Memory is treacherous.\" Compact in size, easy to use, and comprehensive, The Merck Manual (as it\\nwas later known) became a favorite of those involved in medical care and others in need of a medical\\nreference. Even Albert Schweitzer carried a copy to Africa in 1913, and Admiral Byrd carried a copy to the\\nSouth Pole in 1929.\\nBy the 1980s, the book had become the world\\'s largest selling medical text and was translated into more\\nthan a dozen languages. While the name of the parent company has changed somewhat over the years,\\nthe book\\'s name has remained constant, known officially as The Merck Manual of Diagnosis and\\nTherapy but usually referred to as The Merck Manual and sometimes \"The Merck.\"\\nIn 1990, the editors of The Merck Manual introduced The Merck Manual of Geriatrics . This new book\\nquickly became the best-selling textbook of geriatric medicine, providing specific and comprehensive\\ninformation on the care of older people. The 3rd edition was published in five languages.\\nIn 1997, The Merck Manual of Medical Information-Home Edition  was published. In this revolutionary\\nbook, the editors translated the complex medical information in The Merck Manual into plain language,\\nproducing a book meant for all those people interested in medical care who did not have a medical\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition\\nFront Matter\\n5\\nrashmi.kare@gmail.com\\nAX3B9D2EQG\\nThis file is meant for personal use by rashmi.kare@gmail.com only.\\nSharing or publishing the contents in part or full is liable for legal action.', \"degree. The book received critical acclaim and sold over 2 million copies. The Second Home Edition was\\nreleased in 2003. Merck's commitment to providing comprehensive, understandable medical information\\nto all people continued with The Merck Manual Home Health Handbook, published in 2009.\\nThe Merck Manual of Health & Aging , published in 2004, continued Merck's commitment to education\\nand geriatric care, providing information on aging and the care of older people in words understandable\\nby the lay public.\\nIn 2008, The Merck Manual of Patient Symptoms  was introduced to complement The Merck Manual\\nand was intended to help newcomers to clinical diagnosis approach patients who present with certain\\ncommon symptoms.\\nAs part of its commitment to ensuring that all who need and want medical information can get it, Merck\\nprovides the content of these Merck Manuals on the web for free (www.merckmanuals.com).

The web publications are continuously updated to ensure that the\\ninformation is as up-to-date as possible.\\nMerck also supports the community of chemists and others with the need to know about chemical\\ncompounds with The Merck Index. First published in 1889, this publication actually predates The Merck\\nManual and is the most widely used text of its kind. The Merck Veterinary Manual  was first published in\\n1955. It provides information on the health care of animals and is the preeminent text in its field.\\nMerck & Co., Inc., is one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies.

Nutrition: General Considerations\\nIntroduction\\nNutrition is the science of food and its relationship to health. Nutrients are chemicals in foods that are\\nused by the body for growth, maintenance, and energy. Nutrients that cannot be synthesized by the body\\nand thus must be derived from the diet are considered essential. They include vitamins, minerals, some\\namino acids, and some fatty acids. Nutrients that the body can synthesize from other compounds,\\nalthough they may also be derived from the diet, are considered nonessential. Macronutrients are\\nrequired by the body in relatively large amounts; micronutrients are needed in minute amounts.\\nLack of nutrients can result in deficiency syndromes (eg, kwashiorkor, pellagra) or other disorders (see p.\\n9). Excess intake of macronutrients can lead to obesity (see p. 56) and related disorders; excess intake of\\nmicro-nutrients can be toxic. Also, the balance of various types of nutrients, such as how much\\nusaturated vs saturated fat is consumed, can influence the development of disorders.\\nMacronutrients\\nMacronutrients constitute the bulk of the diet and supply energy and many essential nutrients.\\nCarbohydrates, proteins (including essential amino acids), fats (including essential fatty acids),\\nmacrominerals, and water are macronutrients. Carbohydrates, fats, and proteins are interchangeable as\\nsources of energy; fats yield 9 kcal/g (37.8 kJ/g); proteins and carbohydrates yield 4 kcal/g (16.8 kJ/g).\\nCarbohydrates: Dietary carbohydrates are broken down into glucose and other monosaccharides.\\nCarbohydrates increase blood glucose levels, supplying energy. Simple carbohydrates are composed of\\nsmall molecules, generally monosaccharides or disaccharides, which increase blood glucose levels\\nrapidly. Complex carbohydrates are composed of larger molecules, which are broken down into\\nmonosaccharides. Complex carbohydrates increase blood glucose levels more slowly but for a longer\\ntime. Glucose and sucrose are simple carbohydrates; starches and fiber are complex carbohydrates.', 'The glycemic index measures how rapidly consumption of a carbohydrate increases plasma glucose\\nlevels. Values range from 1 (the slowest increase) to 100 (the fastest increase, equivalent to pure glucose\\n—see\\nTable 1-1). However, the actual rate of increase also depends on what foods are consumed with the\\ncarbohydrate.\\nCarbohydrates with a high glycemic index may increase plasma glucose to high levels rapidly. It is\\nhypothesized that, as a result, insulin levels increase, inducing hypoglycemia and hunger, which tends to\\nlead to consumption of excess calories and weight gain. Carbohydrates with a low glycemic index\\nincrease plasma glucose levels slowly, resulting in lower postprandial insulin levels and less hunger,\\nwhich probably makes consumption of excess calories less likely. These effects are predicted to result in\\na more favorable lipid profile and a decreased risk of obesity, diabetes mellitus, and complications of\\ndiabetes if present.\\nProteins: Dietary proteins are broken down into peptides and amino acids. Proteins are required for\\ntissue maintenance, replacement, function, and growth. However, if the body is not getting enough\\ncalories from dietary sources or tissue stores (particularly of fat), protein may be used for energy.\\nAs the body uses dietary protein for tissue production, there is a net gain of protein (positive nitrogen\\nbalance). During catabolic\\n[Table 1-1. Glycemic Index of Some Foods]\\nstates (eg, starvation, infections, burns), more protein may be used (because body tissues are broken\\ndown) than is absorbed, resulting in a net loss of protein (negative nitrogen balance). Nitrogen balance is\\nbest determined by subtracting the amount of nitrogen excreted in urine and feces from the amount of\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition\\nChapter 1.

All people require 8 EAAs; infants also require histidine.\\nThe weight-adjusted requirement for dietary protein correlates with growth rate, which decreases from\\ninfancy until adulthood. The daily dietary protein requirement decreases from 2.2 g/kg in 3-mo-old infants\\nto 1.2 g/kg in 5-yr-old children and to 0.8 g/kg in adults. Protein requirements correspond to EAA\\nrequirements (see\\nTable 1-2). Adults trying to increase muscle mass need very little extra protein beyond the requirements in\\nthe table.\\nThe amino acid composition of protein varies widely. Biological value (BV) reflects the similarity in amino\\nacid composition of protein to that of animal tissues; thus, BV indicates what percentage of a dietary\\nprotein provides EAAs for the body. A perfect match is egg protein, with a value of 100. Animal proteins in\\nmilk and meat have a high BV (~90); proteins in cereal and vegetables have a lower BV (~40), and some\\nderived proteins (eg, gelatin) have a BV of 0. The extent to which dietary proteins supply each other's\\nmissing amino acids (complementarity) determines the overall BV of the diet. The recommended daily\\nallowances (RDA) for protein assumes that the average mixed diet has a BV of 70.\\nFats: Fats are broken down into fatty acids and glycerol. Fats are required for tissue growth and hormone\\nproduction. Saturated fatty acids, common in animal fats, tend to be solid at room temperature. Except for\\npalm and coconut oils, fats derived from plants tend to be liquid at room temperature; these fats contain\\nhigh levels of monounsaturated fatty acids or polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs).\\nPartial hydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids (as occurs during food manufacturing) produces trans\\nfatty acids, which are solid or semisolid at room temperature. In the US, the main dietary source of trans\\nfatty acids is partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, used in manufacturing certain foods (eg, cookies,\", 'fatty acids is partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, used in manufacturing certain foods (eg, cookies,\\ncrackers, chips) to prolong shelf-life. Trans fatty acids may elevate LDL cholesterol and lower HDL; they\\nmay also independently increase the risk of coronary artery disease.\\nEssential fatty acids (EFAs) are linoleic acid, an ω-6 (n-6) fatty acid, and linolenic acid, an ω-3 (n-3) fatty\\nacid. Other ω-6 acids (eg, arachidonic acid) and other ω-3 fatty acids (eg, eicosapentaenoic acid,\\ndocosahexaenoic acid) are required by the body but can be synthesized from EFAs.\\nEFAs (see also p. 19) are needed for the formation of various eicosanoids (biologically active lipids),\\nincluding prostaglandins, thromboxanes, prostacyclins, and leukotrienes. Consumption of ω-3 fatty acids\\nmay decrease the risk of coronary artery disease.\\n[Table 1-2. Essential Amino Acid Requirements in mg/kg Body Weight]\\nRequirements for EFAs vary by age. Adults require amounts of linoleic acid equal to at least 2% of total\\ncaloric needs and linolenic acid equal to at least 0.5%. Vegetable oils provide linoleic acid and linolenic\\nacid. Oils made from safflower, sunflower, corn, soya, primrose, pumpkin, and wheat germ provide large\\namounts of linoleic acid. Marine fish oils and oils made from flax-seeds, pumpkin, soy, and canola provide\\nlarge amounts of linolenic acid. Marine fish oils also provide some other ω-3 fatty acids in large amounts.\\nMacrominerals: Na, Cl, K, Ca, P, and Mg are required in relatively large amounts per day (see\\nTables 1-3,\\n1-4, and\\n5-2).\\nWater: Water is considered a macronutrient because it is required in amounts of 1 mL/kcal (0.24 mL/kJ)\\nof energy expended, or about 2500 mL/day. Needs vary with fever, physical activity, and changes in\\nclimate and humidity.', 'climate and humidity.\\n[Table 1-3.

Recommended Dietary Reference Intakes* for Some Macronutrients, Food and Nutrition\\nBoard, Institute of Medicine of the National Academies]\\nMicronutrients\\nVitamins and minerals required in minute amounts (trace minerals) are micronutrients (see Chs. 4 and 5).\\nWater-soluble vitamins are vitamin C (ascorbic acid) and 8 members of the vitamin B complex: biotin,\\nfolate, niacin, pantothenic acid, riboflavin (vitamin B2), thiamin (vitamin B1), vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), and\\nvitamin B12 (cobalamin).\\nFat-soluble vitamins are vitamins A (retinol), D (cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol), E (α-tocopherol), and\\nK (phylloquinone and menaquinone).\\nOnly vitamins A, E, and B12 are stored to any significant extent in the body; the other vitamins must be\\nconsumed regularly to maintain tissue health.\\nEssential trace minerals include chromium, copper, iodine, iron, manganese, molybdenum, selenium,\\nand zinc. Except for chromium, each of these is incorporated into enzymes or hormones required in\\nmetabolism. Except for deficiencies of iron and zinc, micromineral deficiencies are uncommon in\\ndeveloped countries (see Ch. 5).\\nOther minerals (eg, aluminum, arsenic, boron, cobalt, fluoride, nickel, silicon, vanadium) have not been\\nproved essential for people. Fluoride, although not essential, helps prevent tooth decay by forming a\\ncompound with Ca (CaF2), which stabilizes the mineral matrix in teeth.\\nAll trace minerals are toxic at high levels, and some (arsenic, nickel, and chromium) may cause cancer.\\nOther Dietary Substances\\nThe daily human diet typically contains as many as 100,000 chemicals (eg, coffee contains 1000). Of\\nthese, only 300 are nutrients, only some of which are essential. However, many nonnutrients in foods are\\nuseful. For example, food additives (eg, preservatives, emulsifiers, antioxidants, stabilizers) improve the', \"production and stability of foods. Trace components (eg, spices, flavors, odors, colors, phytochemicals,\\nmany other natural products) improve appearance and taste.\\nFiber: Fiber occurs in various forms (eg, cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, gums). It increases GI motility,\\nprevents constipation, and helps control diverticular disease. Fiber is thought to accelerate the elimination\\nof cancer-causing substances produced by bacteria in the large intestine. Epidemiologic evidence\\nsuggests an association between colon cancer and low fiber intake and a beneficial effect of fiber in\\npatients with functional bowel disorders, Crohn's disease, obesity, and hemorrhoids. Soluble fiber\\n(present in fruits, vegetables, oats, barley, and legumes) reduces the postprandial increase in blood\\nglucose and insulin and can reduce cholesterol levels.\\nThe typical Western diet is low in fiber (about 12 g/day) because of a high intake of highly refined wheat\\nflour and a low intake of fruits and vegetables. Increasing fiber intake to about 30 g/day by consuming\\nmore vegetables, fruits, and high-fiber cereals and grains is generally recommended. However, very high\\nfiber intake may reduce absorption of certain minerals.\\nNutritional Requirements\\nGood nutrition aims to achieve and maintain a desirable body composition and high potential for physical\\nand mental work. Balancing energy intake with energy expenditure is necessary for a desirable body\\nweight. Energy expenditure depends on age, sex, weight (see Table 1-4), and metabolic and physical\\nactivity. If energy intake exceeds expenditure, weight is gained. Taking in about 100 calories/day more\\nthan needed results in a weight gain of about 4 to 5 kg in a year. If energy intake is less than expenditure,\\nweight is lost.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition\\nChapter 1.

The recommendations are individualized based on age, sex, and\\nphysical activity (see\\nTable 1-5). Generally, the recommended intake decreases with aging because physical activity tends to\\ndecrease, resulting in less energy expended. The new Food Guide Pyramid emphasizes the following:\\n• Increasing consumption of whole grains\\n• Increasing consumption of vegetables and fruits\\n• Substituting fat-free or low-fat milk products (or equivalents) for whole-fat milk products\\n• Reducing consumption of saturated fats and trans fatty acids\\n• Exercising regularly\\nAdequate fluid intake is also important.\\nFats should constitute ≤ 30% of total calories, and saturated and trans fatty acids should constitute <\\n10%.

A dietitian can obtain a more detailed dietary history. It usually includes a list of foods\\neaten within the previous 24 h and a food questionnaire. A food diary may be used to record all foods\\neaten.

For example, nitrite, which is used in cured\\nmeats, inhibits the growth of Clostridium botulinum and improves flavor. However, nitrite converts to\\nnitrosamines, which are carcinogens in animals. On the other hand, the amount of nitrite added to cured\\nmeat is small compared with the amount from naturally occurring food nitrates converted to nitrite by the\\nsalivary glands. Dietary vitamin C can reduce nitrite formation in the GI tract. Rarely, some additives (eg,\\nsulfites) cause food hypersensitivity (allergy) reactions.

Undernutrition\\nIntroduction\\nUndernutrition is a form of malnutrition. (Malnutrition also includes overnutrition—see Ch. 6).\\nUndernutrition can result from inadequate ingestion of nutrients, malabsorption, impaired\\nmetabolism, loss of nutrients due to diarrhea, or increased nutritional requirements (as occurs\\nin cancer or infection). Undernutrition progresses in stages; each stage usually takes\\nconsiderable time to develop. First, nutrient levels in blood and tissues change, followed by\\nintracellular changes in biochemical functions and structure. Ultimately, symptoms and signs\\nappear.\\nRisk Factors\\nUndernutrition is associated with many disorders and circumstances, including poverty and social\\ndeprivation. Risk is also greater at certain times (ie, during infancy, early childhood, adolescence,\\npregnancy, breastfeeding, and old age).\\nInfancy and childhood: Infants and children are particularly susceptible to undernutrition because of\\ntheir high demand for energy and essential nutrients. Because vitamin K does not readily cross the\\nplacenta, neonates may be deficient, so all are given a single injection of vitamin K within 1 h of birth to\\nprevent hemorrhagic disease of the newborn, a life-threatening disorder (see pp. 46 and\\n2783). Infants fed only breast milk, which is typically low in vitamin D, are given supplemental vitamin D;\\nthey can develop vitamin B12 deficiency if the mother is a vegan. Inadequately fed infants and children\\nare at risk of protein-energy undernutrition (PEU—previously called protein-energy malnutrition) and\\ndeficiencies of iron, folate (folic acid), vitamins A and C, copper, and zinc. During adolescence, nutritional\\nrequirements increase because the growth rate accelerates. Anorexia nervosa (see p. 1535) may affect\\nadolescent girls in particular.\\nPregnancy and breastfeeding: Requirements for nutrients increase during pregnancy and\\nbreastfeeding. Aberrations of diet, including pica (consumption of nonnutritive substances, such as clay\\nand charcoal), may occur during pregnancy. Anemia due to iron deficiency is common, as is anemia due\\nto folate deficiency, especially among women who have taken oral contraceptives. Vitamin D deficiency is\\ncommon during late pregnancy, predisposing the child to decreased bone mass.', \"common during late pregnancy, predisposing the child to decreased bone mass.\\nOld age: Aging—even when disease or dietary deficiency is absent—leads to sarcopenia (progressive\\nloss of lean body mass), starting after age 40 and eventually amounting to a muscle loss of about 10 kg\\n(22 lb) in men and 5 kg (11 lb) in women. Undernutrition contributes to sarcopenia, and sarcopenia\\naccounts for many of the complications of undernutrition (eg, decreased nitrogen balance, increased\\nsusceptibility to infections). Causes of sarcopenia include the following:\\n• Decreased physical activity\\n• Decreased food intake\\n• Increased levels of cytokines (particularly interleukin-6)\\n• Decreased levels of growth hormone and mechano growth factor (insulin-like growth factor-3)\\n• In men, decreasing androgen levels\\nAging decreases basal metabolic rate (due mainly to decreased fat-free mass), total body weight, height,\\nand skeletal mass; aging increases mean body fat (as a percentage of body weight) to about 30% (from\\n20%) in men and to 40% (from 27%) in women.\\nFrom age 20 to 80, food intake decreases, especially in men. Anorexia due to aging itself has many\\ncauses, including reduced adaptive relaxation of the stomach's fundus, increased release and activity of\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition\\nChapter 2.

Diminished taste and smell can decrease eating pleasure but usually decrease food intake only\\nslightly. Anorexia may have other causes (eg, loneliness, inability to shop or prepare meals, dementia,\\nsome chronic disorders, use of certain drugs). Depression is a common cause. Occasionally, anorexia\\nnervosa (sometimes called anorexia tardive in the elderly), paranoia, or mania interferes with eating.\\nDental problems limit the ability to chew and subsequently to digest foods. Swallowing difficulties (eg, due\\nto strokes, other neurologic disorders, esophageal candidiasis, or xerostomia) are common. Poverty or\\nfunctional impairment limits access to nutrients.\\nThe institutionalized elderly are at particular risk of PEU. They are often confused and may be unable to\\nexpress hunger or preferences for foods. They may be physically unable to feed themselves. Chewing or\\nswallowing may be very slow, making it tedious for another person to feed them enough food.\\nIn the elderly, particularly the institutionalized elderly, inadequate intake and often decreased absorption\\nor synthesis of vitamin D, increased demand for vitamin D, and inadequate exposure to sunshine\\ncontribute to osteomalacia (see p. 41).\\nDisorders and medical procedures: Diabetes, some chronic disorders that affect the GI tract, intestinal\\nresection, and certain other GI surgical procedures tend to impair absorption of fat-soluble vitamins,\\nvitamin B12, Ca, and iron. Gluten enteropathy, pancreatic insufficiency, or other disorders can result in\\nmalabsorption. Decreased absorption possibly contributes to iron deficiency and osteoporosis. Liver\\ndisorders impair storage of vitamins A and B12 and interfere with metabolism of protein and energy\\nsources. Renal insufficiency predisposes to protein, iron, and vitamin D deficiencies. Anorexia causes\\nsome patients with cancer or depression and many with AIDS to consume inadequate amounts of food.\\nInfections, trauma, hyperthyroidism, extensive burns, and prolonged fever increase metabolic demands.\\nAny condition that increases cytokines may be accompanied by muscle loss, lipolysis, low albumin levels,\\nand anorexia.', 'and anorexia.\\nVegetarian diets: Iron deficiency can occur in ovo-lacto vegetarians (although such a diet can be\\ncompatible with good health). Vegans may develop vitamin B12 deficiency unless they consume yeast\\nextracts or Asian-style fermented foods. Their intake of Ca, iron, and zinc also tends to be low. A fruit-only\\ndiet is not recommended because it is deficient in protein, Na, and many micronutrients.\\nFad diets: Some fad diets result in vitamin, mineral, and protein deficiencies; cardiac, renal, and\\nmetabolic disorders; and sometimes death. Very low calorie diets (< 400 kcal/day) cannot sustain health\\nfor long.\\nDrugs and nutritional supplements: Many drugs (eg, appetite suppressants, digoxin) decrease\\nappetite; others impair nutrient absorption or metabolism. Some drugs (eg, stimulants) have catabolic\\neffects. Certain drugs can impair absorption of many nutrients; eg, anticonvulsants can impair absorption\\nof vitamins.\\nAlcohol or drug dependency: Patients with alcohol or drug dependency may neglect their nutritional\\nneeds. Absorption and metabolism of nutrients may also be impaired. IV drug addicts typically become\\nundernourished, as do\\n[\\nTable 2-1.

For example,\\nimpaired night vision may indicate vitamin A deficiency.\\nPhysical examination: Physical examination should include measurement of height and weight,\\ninspection of body fat distribution, and anthropometric measurements of lean body mass. Body mass\\nindex (BMI = weight(kg)/height(m)2) adjusts weight for height (see\\nTable 6-2 on p. 59).

The formula for calculating the mid upper arm muscle area in cm2 is as follows:\\nThis formula corrects the upper arm area for fat and bone. Average values for the mid upper arm muscle\\narea are 54 ± 11 cm2 for men and 30 ± 7 cm2 for women. A value < 75% of this standard (depending on\\nage) indicates depletion of lean body mass (see\\nTable 2-2). This measurement may be affected by physical activity, genetic factors, and age-related\\nmuscle loss.\\nPhysical examination should focus on signs of specific nutritional deficiencies. Signs of PEU (eg, edema,\", \"muscle wasting, skin changes) should be sought. Examination should also focus on signs of conditions\\nthat could predispose to nutritional deficiencies, such as dental problems. Mental status should be\\nassessed, because depression and cognitive impairment can lead to weight loss.\\nThe widely used Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) uses information from the patient history (eg,\\nweight loss, change in intake, GI symptoms), physical examination findings (eg, loss of muscle and\\nsubcutaneous fat, edema, ascites), and the clinician's judgment of the patient's nutritional status.

It commonly includes deficiencies of\\nmany micronutrients. PEU can be sudden and total (starvation) or gradual. Severity ranges from\\nsubclinical deficiencies to obvious wasting (with edema, hair loss, and skin atrophy) to\\nstarvation. Multiple organ systems are often impaired. Diagnosis usually involves laboratory\\ntesting, including serum albumin. Treatment consists of correcting fluid and electrolyte deficits\\nwith IV solutions, then gradually replenishing nutrients, orally if possible.\\nIn developed countries, PEU is common among the institutionalized elderly (although often not suspected)\\nand among patients with disorders that decrease appetite or impair nutrient digestion, absorption, or\\nmetabolism. In developing countries, PEU affects children who do not consume enough calories or\\nprotein.\\nClassification and Etiology\\nPEU is graded as mild, moderate, or severe. Grade is determined by calculating weight as a percentage', 'of expected weight for length or height using international standards (normal, 90 to 110%; mild PEU, 85 to\\n90%; moderate, 75 to 85%; severe, <75%).\\nPEU may be primary or secondary. Primary PEU is caused by inadequate nutrient intake. Secondary PEU\\nresults from disorders or drugs that interfere with nutrient use.\\nPrimary PEU: Worldwide, primary PEU occurs mostly in children and the elderly who lack access to\\nnutrients, although a common cause in the elderly is depression. PEU can also result from fasting or\\nanorexia nervosa. Child or elder abuse may be a cause.\\nIn children, chronic primary PEU has 2 common forms: marasmus and kwashiorkor. The form depends on\\nthe balance of nonprotein and protein sources of energy. Starvation is an acute severe form of primary\\nPEU.\\nMarasmus (also called the dry form of PEU) causes weight loss and depletion of fat and muscle.

So children with kwashiorkor tend to be older than those with marasmus. Kwashiorkor may also\\nresult from an acute illness, often gastroenteritis or another infection (probably secondary to cytokine\\nrelease), in a child who already has PEU. A diet that is more deficient in protein than energy may be more\\nlikely to cause kwashiorkor than marasmus. Less common than marasmus, kwashiorkor tends to be\\nconfined to specific parts of the world, such as rural Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific islands. In\\nthese areas, staple foods (eg, yams, cassavas, sweet potatoes, green bananas) are low in protein and\\nhigh in carbohydrates. In kwashiorkor, cell membranes leak, causing extravasation of intravascular fluid\\nand protein, resulting in peripheral edema.\\nStarvation is a complete lack of nutrients. It occasionally occurs when food is available (as in fasting or\\nanorexia nervosa) but usually occurs because food is unavailable (eg, during famine or wilderness\\nexposure).\\nSecondary PEU: This type most commonly results from the following:\\n• Disorders that affect GI function: These disorders can interfere with digestion (eg, pancreatic\\ninsufficiency), absorption (eg, enteritis, enteropathy), or lymphatic transport of nutrients (eg,\\nretroperitoneal fibrosis, Milroy's disease).\\n• Wasting disorders: In wasting disorders (eg, AIDS, cancer) and renal failure, catabolism causes cytokine\\nexcess, resulting in undernutrition via anorexia and cachexia (wasting of muscle and fat). End-stage\\nheart failure can cause cardiac cachexia, a severe form of undernutrition; mortality rate is particularly\\nhigh. Factors contributing to cardiac cachexia may include passive hepatic congestion (causing\\nanorexia), edema of the intestinal tract (impairing absorption), and, in advanced disease, increased O2\\nrequirement due to anaerobic metabolism.

Wasting disorders can decrease appetite or impair\\nmetabolism of nutrients.\\n• Conditions that increase metabolic demands: These conditions include infections, hyperthyroidism,\\npheochromocytoma, other endocrine disorders, burns, trauma, surgery, and other critical illnesses.\\nPathophysiology\\nThe initial metabolic response is decreased metabolic rate. To supply energy, the body first breaks down\\nadipose tissue. However, later when these tissues are depleted, the body may use protein for energy,\\nresulting in a negative nitrogen balance. Visceral organs and muscle are broken down and decrease in\\nweight. Loss of organ weight is greatest in the liver and intestine, intermediate in the heart and kidneys,\\nand least in the nervous system.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nSymptoms of moderate PEU can be constitutional or involve specific organ systems. Apathy and irritability\\nare common. The patient is weak, and work capacity decreases. Cognition and sometimes\\nconsciousness are impaired. Temporary lactose deficiency and achlorhydria develop. Diarrhea is common\\nand can be aggravated by deficiency of intestinal disaccharidases, especially lactase (see p. 157).\\nGonadal tissues atrophy.

Skin in different areas of the body may be affected at different times. The hair can\\nbecome thin, reddish brown, or gray. Scalp hair falls out easily, eventually becoming sparse, but eyelash\\nhair may grow excessively.

Thus, certain symptoms of PEU do not have time to develop.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Diagnosis usually based on history\\n• To determine severity: BMI, serum albumin, total lymphocyte count, CD4+ count, serum transferrin\\n• To diagnose complications and consequences: CBC, electrolytes, BUN, glucose, Ca, Mg, phosphate\\nDiagnosis can be based on history when dietary intake is markedly inadequate. The cause of inadequate\\nintake, particularly in children, needs to be identified. In children and adolescents, child abuse and\\nanorexia nervosa should be considered.', 'anorexia nervosa should be considered.\\nPhysical examination findings can usually confirm the diagnosis. Laboratory tests are required if dietary\\nhistory does not clearly indicate inadequate caloric intake. Measurement of serum albumin, total\\nlymphocyte count, CD4+ T lymphocytes, transferrin, and response to skin antigens may help determine\\nthe severity of PEU (see Table 2-3) or confirm the diagnosis in borderline cases. Many other test results\\nmay be abnormal: eg, decreased levels of hormones, vitamins, lipids, cholesterol, prealbumin, insulin\\ngrowth factor-1, fibronectin, and retinol-binding protein. Urinary creatine and methylhistidine levels can be\\nused to gauge the degree of muscle wasting. Because protein catabolism slows, urinary urea level also\\ndecreases. These findings rarely affect treatment.\\nLaboratory tests are required to identify causes of suspected secondary PEU. C-reactive protein or\\nsoluble interleukin-2 receptor should be measured when the cause of undernutrition is unclear; these\\nmeasurements can help determine whether there is cytokine excess. Thyroid function tests may also be\\ndone.\\nOther laboratory tests can detect associated abnormalities that may require treatment. Serum\\nelectrolytes, BUN, glucose, and possibly levels of Ca, Mg, and phosphate should be measured. Levels of\\nserum glucose, electrolytes (especially K, occasionally Na), phosphate, Ca, and Mg are usually low. BUN\\nis often low unless renal failure is present. Metabolic acidosis may be present.

Nutritional Support\\nIntroduction\\nMany undernourished patients need nutritional support, which aims to increase lean body mass. Oral\\nfeeding can be difficult for some patients with anorexia or with eating or absorption problems. Behavioral\\nmeasures that sometimes enhance oral intake include the following:\\n• Encouraging patients to eat\\n• Heating or seasoning foods\\n• Providing favorite or strongly flavored foods\\n• Encouraging patients to eat small portions\\n• Scheduling around meals\\n• Assisting patients with feeding\\nIf behavioral measures are ineffective, nutritional support—oral, enteral tube, or parenteral nutrition—is\\nindicated, except sometimes for dying or severely demented patients (see p. 25).\\nPredicting Nutritional Requirements\\nNutritional requirements are predicted so that interventions can be planned. Requirements can be\\nestimated by formulas or measured by indirect calorimetry. Indirect calorimetry requires use of a metabolic\\ncart (a closed rebreathing system that determines energy expenditure based on total CO2 production),\\nwhich requires special expertise and is not always available. Thus, total energy expenditure (TEE) and\\nprotein requirements usually are estimated.\\nEnergy expenditure: TEE varies based on the patient's weight, activity level, and degree of metabolic\\nstress (metabolic demands); TEE ranges from 25 kcal/kg/day for people who are sedentary and not under\\nstress to about 40 kcal/kg/day for people who are critically ill. TEE equals the sum of\\n• Resting metabolic rate (RMR, or resting energy expenditure rate), which is normally about 70% of TEE\\n• Energy dissipated by metabolism of food (10% of TEE)\\n• Energy expended during physical activity (20% of TEE)\\nUndernutrition can decrease RMR up to 20%. Conditions that increase metabolic stress (eg, critical\\nillness, infection, inflammation, trauma, surgery) can increase RMR but rarely by > 50%.\\nThe Mifflin-St. Jeor equation estimates RMR more precisely and with fewer errors than the commonly\\nused Harris-Benedict equation, usually providing results that are within 20% of those measured by\\nindirect calorimetry. The Mifflin-St. Jeor equation estimates RMR as follows:\\nMen: kcal / day = 66 + (13.7 × wt[kg]) + (5 × height[cm]) - (6.8 × age)\", 'Women: kcal / day = 665 + (9.6 × wt[kg]) + (1.8 × height[cm]) - (4.7 × age)\\nTEE can be estimated by adding about 10% (for sedentary people) to about 40% (for people who are\\ncritically ill) to RMR.\\nProtein requirements: For healthy people, protein requirements are estimated at 0.8 g/kg/day.\\nHowever, for patients with metabolic stress or kidney failure and for elderly patients, requirements may be\\nhigher (see\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition\\nChapter 3.

Clinicians commonly use indicators of lean body mass\\nsuch as the following:\\n• Body mass index (BMI)\\n• Body composition analysis\\n• Body fat distribution (see pp.\\n11 and 58)\\nNitrogen balance, response to skin antigens, muscle strength measurement, and indirect calorimetry can\\nalso be used.\\n[Table 3-1. Estimated Adult Daily Protein Requirement]\\nNitrogen balance, which reflects the balance between protein needs and supplies, is the difference\\nbetween amount of nitrogen ingested and amount lost. A positive balance (ie, more ingested than lost)\\nimplies adequate intake. Precise measurement is impractical, but estimates help assess response to\\nnutritional support. Nitrogen intake is estimated from protein intake: nitrogen (g) equals protein (g)/6.25.\\nEstimated nitrogen losses consist of urinary nitrogen losses (estimated by measuring urea nitrogen\\ncontent of an accurately obtained 24-h urine collection) plus stool losses (estimated at 1 g/day if stool is\\nproduced; negligible if stool is not produced) plus insensible and other unmeasured losses (estimated at\\n3 g).\\nResponse to skin antigens, a measure of delayed hypersensitivity, often increases to normal as\\nundernourished patients respond to nutritional support. However, other factors can affect response to\\nskin antigens.\\nMuscle strength indirectly reflects increases in lean body mass. It can be measured quantitatively, by\\nhand-grip dynamometry, or electrophysiologically (typically by stimulating the ulnar nerve with an\\nelectrode).\\nLevels of acute-phase reactant serum proteins (particularly short-lived proteins such as prealbumin\\n[transthyretin], retinol-binding protein, and transferrin) sometimes correlate with improved nutritional\\nstatus, but these levels correlate better with inflammatory conditions.\\nEnteral Tube Nutrition\\nEnteral tube nutrition is indicated for patients who have a functioning GI tract but cannot ingest enough\\nnutrients orally because they are unable or unwilling to take oral feedings.

If a nasal injury or deformity makes\\nnasal placement difficult, an orogastric or other oroenteric tube can be placed.\\nTube feeding for > 4 to 6 wk usually requires a gastrostomy or jejunostomy tube, placed endoscopically,\\nsurgically, or radiologically. Choice depends on physician capabilities and patient preference.\\nJejunostomy tubes are useful for patients with contraindications to gastrostomy (eg, gastrectomy, bowel\\nobstruction proximal to the jejunum).

Patients with lactose intolerance may be able to tolerate milk-based formulas given slowly by\\ncontinuous infusion.\\nSpecialized formulas include hydrolyzed protein or sometimes amino acid formulas, which are used for\\npatients who have difficulty digesting complex proteins. However, these formulas are expensive and\\nusually unnecessary. Most patients with pancreatic insufficiency, if given enzymes, and most patients with\\nmalabsorption can digest complex proteins. Other specialized formulas (eg, calorie- and protein-dense\\nformulas for patients whose fluids are restricted, fiber-enriched formulas for constipated patients) may be\\nhelpful.\\nAdministration: Patients should be sitting upright at 30 to 45° during tube feeding and for 1 to 2 h\\nafterward to minimize incidence of nosocomial aspiration pneumonia and to allow gravity to help propel\\nthe food.

The TPN line should\\nnot be used for any other purpose. External tubing should be changed every 24 h with the first bag of the\\nday. In-line filters have not been shown to decrease complications. Dressings should be kept sterile and\\nare usually changed every 48 h using strict sterile techniques. If TPN is given outside the hospital,\\npatients must be taught to recognize symptoms of infection, and qualified home nursing must be\\narranged.\\nThe solution is started slowly at 50% of the calculated requirements, using 5% dextrose to make up the\\nbalance of fluid requirements. Energy and nitrogen should be given simultaneously. The amount of\\nregular insulin given (added directly to the TPN solution) depends on the plasma glucose level; if the\\nlevel is normal and the final solution contains 25% dextrose, the usual starting dose is 5 to 10 units of\\nregular insulin/L of TPN fluid.\\nMonitoring: Progress should be followed on a flowchart. An interdisciplinary nutrition team, if available,\\nshould monitor patients. Weight, CBC, electrolytes, and BUN should be monitored often (eg, daily for\", 'inpatients).

Plasma proteins (eg, serum albumin, possibly transthyretin or retinol-\\nbinding protein), PT, plasma and urine osmolality, and Ca, Mg, and phosphate should be measured\\ntwice/wk. Changes in transthyretin and retinol-binding protein reflect overall clinical status rather than\\nnutritional status alone. If possible, blood tests should not be done during glucose infusion. Full nutritional\\nassessment (including BMI calculation and anthropometric measurements—see pp. 11 and 58) should be\\nrepeated at 2-wk intervals.\\nComplications: About 5 to 10% of patients have complications related to central venous access.\\n[Table 3-3.

Vitamin Deficiency, Dependency, and Toxicity\\nIntroduction\\nVitamins may be fat soluble (vitamins A, D, E, and K) or water soluble (B vitamins and vitamin C). The B\\nvitamins include biotin, folate, niacin, pantothenic acid, riboflavin (B2), thiamin (B1), B6 (eg, pyridoxine),\\nand B12 (cobalamins). For dietary requirements, sources, functions, effects of deficiencies and toxicities,\\nblood levels, and usual therapeutic dosages for vitamins, see\\nTables 4-1 and\\n4-2.\\nDietary requirements for vitamins (and other nutrients) are expressed as daily recommended intake (DRI).\\nThere are 3 types of DRI:\\n• Recommended daily allowance (RDA): RDAs are set to meet the needs of 97 to 98% of healthy\\npeople.\\n• Adequate intake (AI): When data to calculate an RDA are insufficient, AIs are based on observed or\\nexperimentally determined estimates of nutrient intake by healthy people.\\n• Tolerable upper intake level (UL): ULs are the largest amount of a nutrient that most adults can\\ningest daily without risk of adverse health effects.\\nIn developed countries, vitamin deficiencies result mainly from poverty, food faddism, drugs (see p. 7 and\\nTable 4-3), alcoholism, or prolonged and inadequately supplemented parenteral feeding. Mild vitamin\\ndeficiency is common among frail and institutionalized elderly people who have protein-energy\\nundernutrition. In developing countries, deficiencies can result from lack of access to nutrients.\\nDeficiencies of water-soluble vitamins (except vitamin B12) may develop after weeks to months of\\nundernutrition. Deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins and of vitamin B12 take > 1 yr to develop because the\\nbody stores them in relatively large amounts. Intake of vitamins sufficient to prevent classic vitamin\\ndeficiencies (like scurvy or beriberi) may not be adequate for optimum health. This area remains one of\\ncontroversy and active research.\\nVitamin dependency results from a genetic defect involving metabolism of a vitamin. In some cases,\\nvitamin doses as high as 1000 times the DRI improve function of the altered metabolic pathway. Vitamin', 'vitamin doses as high as 1000 times the DRI improve function of the altered metabolic pathway. Vitamin\\ntoxicity (hypervitaminosis) usually results from taking megadoses of vitamin A, D, C, B6, or niacin.\\nBecause many people eat irregularly, foods alone may provide suboptimal amounts of some vitamins. In\\nthese cases, the risk of certain cancers or other disorders may be increased. Because of this risk, routine\\ndaily multivitamin supplements are sometimes recommended.\\nBiotin and Pantothenic Acid\\nBiotin acts as a coenzyme for carboxylation reactions essential to fat and carbohydrate metabolism.\\nAdequate intake for adults is 30 μg/day. Pantothenic acid is widely distributed in foods; it is an essential\\ncomponent of coenzyme A. Adults probably require about 5 mg/day. A beneficial role for pantothenic acid\\nsupplementation in lipid metabolism, RA, or athletic performance remains unproved. Isolated deficiency of\\nbiotin or pantothenic acid virtually never occurs.\\nFolate\\nFolate (folic acid) is now added to enriched grain foods in the US.

For women who have had a fetus or infant with a\\nneural tube defect, the recommended dose is 1000 to 5000 μg/day.\\nNiacin\\nNiacin (nicotinic acid, nicotinamide) derivatives include nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and\\nnicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), which are coenzymes in oxidation-reduction\\nreactions. They are vital in cell metabolism. Because dietary tryptophan can be metabolized to niacin,\\nfoods rich in tryptophan (eg, dairy products) can compensate for inadequate dietary niacin.\\nNiacin Deficiency\\nDietary niacin deficiency (causing pellagra) is uncommon in developed countries. Clinical\\nmanifestations include the \"three Ds\": localized pigmented rash (dermatitis); gastroenteritis\\n(diarrhea); and widespread neurologic deficits, including cognitive decline (dementia).\\nDiagnosis is usually clinical, and dietary supplementation (oral or, if needed, IM) is usually\\nsuccessful.\\nEtiology\\nPrimary deficiency results from extremely inadequate intake of both niacin and tryptophan, which usually\\noccurs in areas where maize (Indian corn) constitutes a substantial part of the diet. Bound niacin, found in\\nmaize, is not assimilated in the GI tract unless it has been previously treated with alkali, as when tortillas', 'are prepared. Corn protein is also deficient in tryptophan. The high incidence of pellagra in India among\\npeople who eat millet with a high leucine content has led to the hypothesis that amino acid imbalance may\\ncontribute to deficiency. Deficiencies of protein and many B vitamins commonly accompany primary niacin\\ndeficiency.\\nSecondary deficiency may be due to diarrhea, cirrhosis, or alcoholism. Pellagra also may occur in\\ncarcinoid syndrome (tryptophan is diverted to form 5-hydroxytryptophan and serotonin) and in Hartnup\\ndisease (absorption of tryptophan by the intestine and kidneys is defective).\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nPellagra is characterized by skin, mucous membrane, CNS, and GI symptoms. Advanced pellagra can\\ncause a symmetric photosensitive rash, stomatitis, glossitis, diarrhea, and mental aberrations. Symptoms\\nmay appear alone or in combination.\\nSkin symptoms include several types of lesions, which are usually bilaterally symmetric.

As the deficiency progresses, the tongue and oral\\nmucous membranes become reddened, followed by pain in the mouth, increased salivation, and edema of\\nthe tongue. Ulcerations may appear, especially under the tongue, on the mucosa of the lower lip, and\\nopposite the molar teeth.\\nGI symptoms early in the deficiency include burning in the pharynx and esophagus and abdominal\\ndiscomfort and distention. Constipation is common. Later, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may occur.\\nDiarrhea is often bloody because of bowel hyperemia and ulceration.\\nCNS symptoms include psychosis, encephalopathy (characterized by impaired consciousness), and\\ncognitive decline (dementia). Psychosis is characterized by memory impairment, disorientation, confusion,\\nand confabulation; the predominant symptom may be excitement, depression, mania, delirium, or\\nparanoia.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Clinical evaluation\\nDiagnosis is clinical and may be straightforward when skin and mouth lesions, diarrhea, delirium, and\\ndementia occur simultaneously. More often, the presentation is not so specific. Differentiating the CNS\\nchanges from those in thiamin deficiency is difficult. A history of a diet lacking niacin and tryptophan may\\nhelp establish the diagnosis. A favorable response to treatment with niacin can usually confirm it. If\\navailable, laboratory testing can help confirm the diagnosis, particularly when the diagnosis is otherwise\\nunclear. Urinary excretion of N1-methylnicotinamide (NMN) is decreased; < 0.8 mg/day (< 5.8 μmol/day)\\nsuggests a niacin deficiency.\\nTreatment\\n• Nicotinamide and other nutrients\\nBecause multiple deficiencies are common, a balanced diet, including other B vitamins (particularly\\nriboflavin and pyridoxine), is needed. Nicotinamide is usually used to treat deficiency, because\\nnicotinamide, unlike nicotinic acid (the most common form of niacin), does not cause flushing, itching,\", 'burning, or tingling sensations. Nicotinamide is given in doses ranging from 40 to 250 mg/day po in\\ndivided doses 3 to 4 times a day.\\nNiacin Toxicity\\nNiacin (nicotinic acid) in large amounts is sometimes used to lower low-density lipoprotein\\n(LDL) cholesterol and triglyceride levels and to increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL)\\ncholesterol levels. Symptoms may include flushing and, rarely, hepatotoxicity.\\nImmediate- and sustained-release preparations of niacin (but not nicotinamide) may improve lipid levels.\\nFlushing, which is prostaglandin-mediated, is more common with immediate-release preparations. It may\\nbe more intense after alcohol ingestion, aerobic activity, sun exposure, and consumption of spicy foods.\\nFlushing is minimized if niacin is taken after meals or if aspirin (325 mg) is taken 30 to 45 min before\\nniacin. The chance of severe flushing can be reduced by starting immediate-release niacin at a low dose\\n(eg, 50 mg tid) and increasing it very slowly. At intermediate doses (1000 mg/day), triglyceride levels\\ndecrease 15 to 20%, and HDL cholesterol levels increase 15 to 30%. Reductions in LDL cholesterol are\\nmodest (< 10%). Higher doses of niacin (3000 mg/day) reduce LDL cholesterol 15 to 20% but may cause\\njaundice, abdominal discomfort, blurred vision, worsening of hyperglycemia, and precipitation of\\npreexisting gout. People with a liver disorder probably should not take high-dose niacin.\\nHepatotoxicity may be more common with some sustained-release preparations.

Normal range is 28 to 86 μg/dL (1 to 3 μmol/L). However, levels\\ndecrease only after the deficiency is advanced because the liver contains large stores of vitamin A. Also,\\ndecreased levels may result from acute infection, which causes retinol-binding protein and transthyretin\\n(also called prealbumin) levels to decrease transiently. A therapeutic trial of vitamin A may help confirm\\nthe diagnosis.\\nPrevention\\nThe diet should include dark green leafy vegetables, deep- or bright-colored fruits (eg, papayas,\\noranges), carrots, and yellow vegetables (eg, squash, pumpkin). Vitamin A-fortified milk and cereals, liver,\\negg yolks, and fish liver oils are helpful. Carotenoids are absorbed better when consumed with some\\ndietary fat.

Both\\ntypes usually cause headache and increased intracranial pressure. Acute toxicity also causes\\nnausea and vomiting. Chronic toxicity also causes changes in skin, hair, and nails; abnormal\\nliver test results; and, in a fetus, birth defects. Diagnosis is usually clinical.

Adults who consume > 1500 RAE (> 4500\\nIU)/day of vitamin A may develop osteoporosis. Infants who are given excessive doses (6,000 to 20,000\\nRAE [18,000 to 60,000 IU]/day) of water-miscible vitamin A may develop toxicity within a few weeks.

Vitamin B6 is important in heme and nucleic acid\\nbiosynthesis and in lipid, carbohydrate, and amino acid metabolism.\\nVitamin B6 Deficiency and Dependency\\nBecause vitamin B6 is present in most foods, dietary deficiency is rare. Secondary deficiency\\nmay result from various conditions. Symptoms can include peripheral neuropathy, a pellagra-\\nlike syndrome, anemia, and seizures, which, particularly in infants, may not resolve when\\ntreated with anticonvulsants.

Diagnosis is usually clinical;\\nno laboratory test readily assesses vitamin B6 status. Treatment consists of giving oral vitamin\\nB6 and, when possible, treating the cause.\\nDietary deficiency, though rare, can develop because extensive processing can deplete foods of vitamin\\nB6. Secondary deficiency most often results from protein-energy undernutrition, malabsorption,\\nalcoholism, use of pyridoxine-inactivating drugs (eg, anticonvulsants, isoniazid, cycloserine, hydralazine,\\ncorticosteroids, penicillamine), or excessive loss.

These compounds are\\ninvolved in nucleic acid metabolism, methyl transfer, and myelin synthesis and repair. They are necessary\\nfor the formation of normal RBCs.\\nFood-bound vitamin B12 is released in the stomach's acid environment and is bound to R protein\\n(haptocorrin). Pancreatic enzymes cleave this B12 complex (B12-R protein) in the small intestine. After\\ncleavage, intrinsic factor, secreted by parietal cells in the gastric mucosa, binds with vitamin B12. Intrinsic\\nfactor is required for absorption of vitamin B12, which takes place in the terminal ileum.\\nVitamin B12 in plasma is bound to transcobalamins I and II. Transcobalamin II is responsible for delivering\", 'vitamin B12 to tissues. The liver stores large amounts of vitamin B12. Enterohepatic reabsorption helps\\nretain vitamin B12.

In such cases, crystalline vitamin B12\\n(such as that available in vitamin supplements) can be absorbed, but food-bound vitamin B12 is not\\nliberated and absorbed normally. Inadequate absorption may occur in blind loop syndrome (with\\novergrowth of bacteria) or fish tapeworm infestation; in these cases, bacteria or parasites use ingested\\nvitamin B12 so that less is available for absorption. Vitamin B12 absorption may be inadequate if ileal\\nabsorptive sites are destroyed by inflammatory bowel disease or are surgically removed. Less common\\ncauses of inadequate vitamin B12 absorption include chronic pancreatitis, gastric surgery, malabsorption\\nsyndromes, AIDS, use of certain drugs (eg, antacids, metformin), repeated exposure to nitrous oxide, and\\na genetic disorder causing malabsorption in the ileum (Imerslund-Graesbeck syndrome).\\nPernicious anemia is often used synonymously with vitamin B12 deficiency. However, pernicious\\nanemia specifically refers to anemia resulting from vitamin B12 deficiency caused by an autoimmune\\nmetaplastic atrophic gastritis with loss of intrinsic factor (see p. 133). Patients with classic pernicious\\nanemia, most commonly younger adults, are at increased risk of stomach and other GI cancers.\\nSubacute combined degeneration refers to degenerative changes in the nervous system due to\\nvitamin B12 deficiency; they affect mostly brain and spinal cord white matter. Demyelinating or axonal\\nperipheral neuropathies can occur.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nAnemia usually develops insidiously. It is often more severe than its symptoms indicate because its slow\\nevolution allows physiologic adaptation. Occasionally, splenomegaly and hepatomegaly occur. Various GI', \"symptoms, including weight loss and poorly localized abdominal pain, may occur. Glossitis, usually\\ndescribed as burning of the tongue, is uncommon.\\nNeurologic symptoms develop independently from and often without hematologic abnormalities. In early\\nstages, decreased position and vibratory sensation in the extremities is accompanied by mild to moderate\\nweakness and hyporeflexia. In later stages, spasticity, extensor plantar responses, greater loss of position\\nand vibratory sensation in the lower extremities, and ataxia emerge. These deficits may develop in a\\nstocking-glove distribution. Tactile, pain, and temperature sensations are usually spared but may be\\ndifficult to assess in the elderly.\\nSome patients are also irritable and mildly depressed. Paranoia (megaloblastic madness), delirium,\\nconfusion, spastic ataxia, and, at times, postural hypotension may occur in advanced cases.

Tissue deficiency and macrocytic indexes may precede the\\ndevelopment of anemia. A vitamin B12 level < 200 pg/mL (< 145 pmol/L) indicates vitamin B12 deficiency.\\nThe folate level is measured because vitamin B12 deficiency must be differentiated from folate deficiency\\nas a cause of megaloblastic anemia; folate supplementation can mask vitamin B12 deficiency and may\\nalleviate megaloblastic anemia but allow the neurologic deficits to progress or even accelerate.\\nWhen clinical judgment suggests vitamin B12 deficiency but the vitamin B12 level is low-normal (200 to\\n350 pg/mL [145 to 260 pmol/L]) or hematologic indexes are normal, other tests can be done. Measuring\\nserum methylmalonic acid (MMA) levels may be useful. An elevated MMA level supports vitamin B12\\ndeficiency but may be due to renal failure. MMA levels can also be used to monitor the response to\\ntreatment. MMA levels remain normal in folate deficiency; homocysteine levels may be elevated with\\neither vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. Less commonly, holotranscobalamin II (transcobalamin II-B12\\ncomplex) content is measured; when holotranscobalamin II is < 40 pg/mL (< 30 pmol/L), vitamin B12 is\\ndeficient.\\nAfter deficiency is diagnosed, additional tests may be indicated for younger adults but usually not for the\\nelderly. Unless dietary vitamin B12 is obviously inadequate, measurement of serum gastrin levels or\\nautoantibodies to intrinsic factor may be done; sensitivity and specificity of these tests may be poor.\\nSchilling test: The Schilling test is useful only if diagnosing intrinsic factor deficiency is important, as in\\nclassic pernicious anemia. This test is not necessary for most elderly patients. The Schilling test\\nmeasures absorption of free radiolabeled vitamin B12. Radiolabeled vitamin B12 is given orally, followed\\nin 1 to 6 h by 1000 μg (1 mg) of parenteral vitamin B12, which reduces uptake of radiolabeled vitamin', 'B12 by the liver. Absorbed radiolabeled vitamin B12 is excreted in urine, which is collected for 24 h. The\\namount excreted is measured, and the percentage of total radiolabeled vitamin B12 is determined. If\\nabsorption is normal, ≥ 9% of the dose given appears in the urine. Reduced urinary excretion (< 5% if\\nkidney function is normal) indicates inadequate vitamin B12 absorption. Improved absorption with the\\nsubsequent addition of intrinsic factor to radiolabeled vitamin B12 confirms the diagnosis of pernicious\\nanemia. The test is often difficult to do or interpret because of incomplete urine collection or renal\\ninsufficiency. In addition, because the Schilling test does not measure absorption of protein-bound vitamin\\nB12, the test does not detect defective liberation of vitamin B12 from foods, which is common among the\\nelderly. The Schilling test repletes vitamin B12 and can mask deficiency, so it should be done only after all\\nother diagnostic tests and therapeutic trials.\\nIf malabsorption is identified, the Schilling test can be repeated after a 2-wk trial of an oral antibiotic.

Treatment\\nconsists of oral vitamin E, given in high doses if there are neurologic deficits or if deficiency\\nresults from malabsorption.\\nVitamin E deficiency causes fragility of RBCs and degeneration of neurons, particularly peripheral axons\\nand posterior column neurons.\\nEtiology\\nIn developing countries, the most common cause is inadequate intake of vitamin E. In developed\\ncountries, the most common causes are disorders that cause fat malabsorption, including\\nabetalipoproteinemia (Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome, due to genetic absence of apolipoprotein B), chronic\\ncholestatic hepatobiliary disease, pancreatitis, short bowel syndrome, and cystic fibrosis. A rare genetic\\nform of vitamin E deficiency without fat malabsorption results from defective liver metabolism.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nThe main symptoms are mild hemolytic anemia and nonspecific neurologic deficits.

Treatment consists of a low-\\ncopper diet and chelation, usually with penicillamine or dimercaprol.\\nWilson's disease is a progressive disorder of copper metabolism that affects 1 person in 30,000. Affected\\npeople are homozygous for the mutant recessive gene, located on chromosome 13. Heterozygous\\ncarriers, who constitute about 1.1% of the population, are asymptomatic.\\nPathophysiology\\nThe genetic defect impairs copper transport. The impaired transport decreases copper secretion into the\\nbile, thus causing the copper overload and resultant accumulation in the liver, which begins at birth. The\\nimpaired transport also interferes with incorporation of copper into the copper protein ceruloplasmin, thus\\ndecreasing serum levels of ceruloplasmin.\\nHepatic fibrosis develops, ultimately causing cirrhosis. Copper diffuses out of the liver into the blood, then\\ninto other tissues. It is most destructive to the brain but also damages the kidneys and reproductive\\norgans and causes hemolytic anemia. Some copper is deposited in Descemet's membrane of the cornea,\\ncausing Kayser-Fleischer rings.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nSymptoms usually develop between ages 5 and 40. In almost half of patients, particularly adolescents,\", \"Symptoms usually develop between ages 5 and 40. In almost half of patients, particularly adolescents,\\nthe first symptom is hepatitis—acute, chronic active, or fulminant. But hepatitis may develop at any time.\\nIn about 40% of patients, particularly young adults, the first symptoms reflect CNS involvement. Motor\\ndeficits are common, including any combination of tremors, dystonia, dysarthria, dysphagia, chorea,\\ndrooling, and incoordination. Sometimes the first symptoms are cognitive or psychiatric abnormalities. In 5\\nto 10% of patients, the first symptom is incidentally noted gold or greenish gold Kayser-Fleischer rings or\\ncrescents (due to copper deposits in the cornea), amenorrhea or repeated miscarriages, or hematuria.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Slit-lamp examination for Kayser-Fleischer rings\\n• Serum ceruloplasmin and 24-h urinary copper excretion\\n• Sometimes confirmation by penicillamine provocation test or liver biopsy\\nWilson's disease should be suspected in people < 40 with any of the following:\\n• An unexplained hepatic, neurologic, or psychiatric disorder\\n• An unexplained persistent elevation in hepatic transaminases\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition\\nChapter 5.

Transaminase levels\\nare also often measured; high levels are consistent with the diagnosis.\\nKayser-Fleischer rings: These rings plus typical motor neurologic abnormalities or a decrease in\\nceruloplasmin are nearly pathognomonic for Wilson's disease. Rarely, these rings occur in other liver\\ndisorders (eg, biliary atresia, primary biliary cirrhosis), but ceruloplasmin levels should be unaffected.\\nCeruloplasmin: Serum ceruloplasmin (normally 20 to 35 mg/dL) is usually low in Wilson's disease but\\ncan be normal. It can also be low in heterozygous carriers and those with other liver disorders (eg, viral\\nhepatitis, drug- or alcohol-induced liver disease). A low ceruloplasmin level in a patient with a Kayser-\\nFleischer ring is diagnostic. Also, a level of < 5 mg/dL is highly suggestive regardless of clinical findings.\\nSerum copper: Despite the copper accumulation in the body, serum copper levels are decreased\\nbecause of the decreased ceruloplasmin levels.\\nUrinary copper excretion: In Wilson's disease, 24-h urinary copper excretion (normally, ≤ 30 μg/day) is\\nusually > 100 μg/day. If serum ceruloplasmin is low and urinary copper excretion is high, diagnosis is\\nclear. If levels are equivocal, measuring urinary copper excretion after penicillamine is given\\n(penicillamine provocation test) may confirm the diagnosis; this test is not usually done in adults because\\ncutoff values are not well-established.\\nLiver biopsy: In unclear cases (eg, elevated transaminases, no Kayser-Fleischer rings, indeterminate\\nvalues for ceruloplasmin and urinary copper), the diagnosis is made by doing a liver biopsy to measure\", \"hepatic copper concentration. However, false-negative results may occur because of a sampling error\\n(due to large variations in copper concentrations in the liver) or fulminant hepatitis (causing necrosis that\\nreleases large amounts of copper).\\nScreening: Because early treatment is most effective, screening is indicated for anyone who has a\\nsibling, cousin, or parent with Wilson's disease. Screening consists of a slit-lamp examination and\\nmeasurement of transaminase levels, serum copper and ceruloplasmin, and 24-h urine copper excretion.\\nIf any results are abnormal, liver biopsy is done to measure hepatic copper concentration. Infants should\\nnot be tested until after age 1 yr because ceruloplasmin levels are low during the first few months of life.\\nChildren < 6 yr with normal test results should be retested 5 to 10 yr later.\\nGenetic testing is under investigation.\\nPrognosis\\nPrognosis is usually good, unless disease is advanced before treatment begins.

After 1 to 5 yr of therapy, lower dose maintenance\\ndrug therapy can be considered. Regular follow-up care with an expert in liver disease is recommended.\\nLiver transplantation may be lifesaving for patients who have Wilson's disease and fulminant hepatic\\nfailure or severe hepatic insufficiency refractory to drugs.\\nFluorine\\nMost of the body's fluorine (F) is contained in bones and teeth. Fluoride (the ionic form of fluorine) is\\nwidely distributed in nature. The main source of fluoride is fluoridated drinking water.\\nDeficiency: Fluorine deficiency can lead to dental caries and possibly osteoporosis. Fluoridation of\", \"water that contains < 1 ppm (the ideal) reduces the incidence of dental caries. If a child's drinking water is\\nnot fluoridated, oral fluoride supplements can be prescribed.\\nToxicity: Excess fluorine can accumulate in teeth and bones, causing fluorosis. Drinking water\\ncontaining > 10 ppm is a common cause. Permanent teeth that develop during high fluoride intake are\\nmost likely to be affected. Exposure must be much greater to affect deciduous teeth.\\nThe earliest signs are chalky white, irregularly distributed patches on the surface of the enamel; these\\npatches become stained yellow or brown, producing a characteristic mottled appearance. Severe toxicity\\nweakens the enamel, pitting its surface. Bony changes, including osteosclerosis, exostoses of the spine,\\nand genu valgum, can develop but only in adults after prolonged high intake of fluoride.\\nNo tests to diagnose toxicity are available.\\nTreatment involves reducing fluoride intake; eg, in areas with high fluoride water levels, patients should\\nnot drink fluoridated water or take fluoride supplements. Children should always be told not to swallow\\nfluoridated toothpastes.\\nIodine\\nIn the body, iodine (I) is involved primarily in the synthesis of 2 thyroid hormones, thyroxine (T4) and\\ntriiodothyronine (T3). Iodine occurs in the environment and in the diet primarily as iodide. In adults, about\\n80% of the iodide absorbed is trapped by the thyroid gland. Most environmental iodine occurs in\\nseawater as iodide; a small amount enters the atmosphere and, through rain, enters ground water and\\nsoil near the sea. Thus, people living far from the sea and at higher altitudes are at particular risk of\\ndeficiency. Fortifying table salt with iodide (typically 70 μg/g) helps ensure adequate intake (150 μg/day).\\nRequirements are higher for pregnant (220 μg/day) and breastfeeding (290 μg/day) women.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition\\nChapter 5.

Iodine deficiency develops\\nwhen iodide intake is < 20 μg/day. In mild or moderate deficiency, the thyroid gland, influenced by thyroid-\\nstimulating hormone (TSH), hypertrophies to concentrate iodide in itself, resulting in colloid goiter.\\nUsually, patients remain euthyroid; however, severe iodine deficiency in adults may cause hypothyroidism\\n(endemic myxedema). It can decrease fertility and increase risk of stillbirth, spontaneous abortion, and\\nprenatal and infant mortality. Severe maternal iodine deficiency retards fetal growth and brain\\ndevelopment, sometimes resulting in birth defects, and, in infants, causes cretinism, which may include\\nintellectual disability, deaf-mutism, difficulty walking, short stature, and sometimes hypothyroidism.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Assessment of thyroid structure and function\\nDiagnosis in adults and children is usually based on thyroid function, examination for goiter, and imaging\\ntests identifying abnormalities in thyroid function and structure (see p.\\n776). All neonates should be screened by measuring the TSH level.\\nTreatment\\n• Iodide with or without levothyroxine\\nInfants with iodine deficiency are given L-thyroxine 3 μg/kg po once/day for a week plus iodide 50 to 90\\nμg po once/day for several weeks to quickly restore a euthyroid state. Children are treated with iodide 90\\nto 120 μg once/day. Adults are given iodide 150 μg once/day. Iodine deficiency can also be treated by\\ngiving levothyroxine. Serum TSH levels are monitored in all patients until the levels are normal (ie, < 5\\nμIU/mL).\\nIodine Toxicity\\nChronic toxicity may develop when intake is > 1.1 mg/day. Most people who ingest excess amounts of\\niodine remain euthyroid. Some people who ingest excess amounts of iodine, particularly those who were\\npreviously deficient, develop hyperthyroidism (Jod-Basedow phenomenon). Paradoxically, excess uptake\\nof iodine by the thyroid may inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis (called Wolff-Chaikoff effect). Thus, iodine', 'toxicity can eventually cause iodide goiter, hypothyroidism, or myxedema. Very large amounts of iodide\\nmay cause a brassy taste in the mouth, increased salivation, GI irritation, and acneiform skin lesions.\\nPatients exposed to frequent large amounts of radiographic contrast dyes or the drug amiodarone also\\nneed to have their thyroid function monitored.\\nDiagnosis is usually based on thyroid function and imaging test findings (see p. 776), which are\\ncorrelated with clinical data. Iodine excretion may be more specific but is not usually measured. Treatment\\nconsists of correcting thyroid abnormalities and, if intake is excessive, dietary modification.\\nIron\\nIron (Fe) is a component of hemoglobin, myoglobin, and many enzymes in the body. Heme iron, contained\\nmainly in animal products, is absorbed much better than nonheme iron (eg, in plants and grains), which\\naccounts for > 85% of iron in the average diet. However, absorption of nonheme iron is increased when it\\nis consumed with animal protein and vitamin C.\\nDeficiency: Iron deficiency is one of the most common mineral deficiencies in the world.

BIA\\nestimates percentage of total body water directly; percentage of body fat is derived indirectly. BIA is most\\nreliable in healthy people and in people with only a few chronic disorders that do not change the\\npercentage of total body water (eg, moderate obesity, diabetes mellitus).

Morbidity and mortality tend to be lower with laparoscopic than with open surgery.\\nHowever, if patients weigh ≥ 180 kg, open surgery is more likely to be successful.

It is the 2nd most common bariatric\\nprocedure. A band is placed around the upper part of the stomach to divide the stomach into a small\\nupper pouch and a larger lower pouch. Saline can be injected into the band via a subcutaneous access\\nport. When saline is injected, the band expands, decreasing the size of the passageway through the\\nstomach. As a result, the upper pouch fills more quickly, sending a message to the brain that the stomach\\nis full; patients eat smaller meals and lose substantial amounts of weight over time. This procedure is\\nusually done laparoscopically. Saline can be removed to make the passageway larger. Even though\\nweight loss from gastric banding is slightly less than that from Roux-en-Y, morbidity and mortality are\\nmuch less and gastric banding can be reversed if necessary.\\nVertical banded gastroplasty is no longer commonly done. A stapler is used to divide the stomach into\\na small upper pouch and a larger lower pouch. A nonexpandable plastic band is placed around the\\nopening where the upper pouch empties into the lower pouch.\\nMalabsorptive procedures: Malabsorptive procedures, such as biliopancreatic diversion with a\\nduodenal switch and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, result in ingested food bypassing parts of the stomach\\nand small intestine, creating malabsorption, which leads to weight loss. These procedures are also\\nrestrictive.\\nRoux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery accounts for about 80% of bariatric procedures in the US. It can\\noften be done laparoscopically. A small part of the proximal stomach is detached from the rest, creating a\\nstomach pouch of < 30 mL. Because stomach volume is smaller, satiety occurs earlier. Also, food\\nbypasses part of the stomach and small intestine, where it is normally absorbed, reducing the amount of\\nfood and calories absorbed. The pouch is connected to the proximal jejunum with a narrow opening,\\nproducing even more restriction. The segment of bypassed proximal small intestine (and thus the', 'producing even more restriction. The segment of bypassed proximal small intestine (and thus the\\nbypassed stomach) is attached to the distal small intestine, enabling bile acids and pancreatic enzymes to\\nmix with GI contents; this mixing limits malabsorption and nutritional deficiencies. Because a\\ngastrojejunostomy is created, symptoms similar to the dumping-syndrome may occur after high glycemic\\nloads; symptoms (light-headedness, diaphoresis, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea) may inhibit the\\nconsumption of such foods by adverse conditioning.\\nBiliopancreatic diversion with a duodenal switch accounts for < 5% of bariatric procedures done in\\nthe US. Part of the stomach is removed, causing restriction. The remaining part empties into the\\nduodenum. The duodenum is cut\\n[\\nFig. 6-2.

Malabsorption and nutritional deficiencies often develop.\\nPreoperative Evaluation\\nEvaluation should determine whether patients have a psychologic commitment to the lifestyle changes\\nand whether operative risks are acceptable. Sleep apnea testing is done.\\nExtensive preoperative evaluation is probably unnecessary. However, for certain morbidly obese patients\\n(BMI > 50 kg/m2), examining the cardiac, pulmonary, GI, metabolic, and psychologic systems helps\\nidentify patients with acceptable operative risk and helps select the appropriate procedure.

Signs of heart failure (eg, increased jugular\\nvenous pressure, hepatomegaly, pulmonary crackles) are hard to identify when body fat is excessive.\\nPulmonary hypertension is also difficult to identify because many patients cannot exercise to the point\\nwhere exertional dyspnea, fatigue, or syncope would result. Pulmonary hypertension is diagnosed if\\nechocardiography shows tricuspid regurgitation and ECG shows tall R waves, right axis deviation, and\\nright ventricular strain.\\n• Sleep study: Polysomnography (see p.\\n1706) can confirm obstructive sleep apnea, which is common, and determine its severity.

Obstructive sleep apnea\\ndoes not contraindicate surgery but is done to help plan for use of continuous positive airway pressure\\n(CPAP) postoperatively.\\nRisks\\nThe most common perioperative complication is wound infection (in about 3%); the most common late\\ncomplication is anastomotic stomach stenosis (in about 5%).\\nOther early complications include wound infection, incisional hernia, small-bowel obstruction, GI bleeding,\\nventral hernia, deep venous thrombosis, and pneumonia. These complications can cause significant\\nmorbidity, prolong hospitalization, and increase costs.\\nThe most common cause of early (within about 6 wk) postoperative death (in up to 0.5%) is pulmonary\\nembolism, followed by anastomotic leak. Tachycardia may be the only early sign of anastomotic leak.\\nLess common causes of early postoperative death are MI, pneumonia, and bowel obstruction.\\nLater problems may include prolonged nausea and vomiting secondary to small-bowel obstruction, and\\nanastomotic stenosis. Nutritional deficiencies (eg, protein-energy undernutrition, vitamin B12 deficiency)\\nmay result from inadequate intake, inadequate supplementation, or malabsorption. Malodorous flatulence,', 'diarrhea, or both may develop, particularly after malabsorptive procedures. Ca and vitamin D absorption\\nmay be impaired, causing deficiencies and sometimes hypocalcemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism.\\nWith prolonged vomiting, thiamin deficiency may occur. After Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, iron deficiency\\nmay result. Patients may have symptoms of reflux, especially after biliopancreatic diversion with a\\nduodenal switch. After rapid weight loss, cholelithiasis may develop.\\nEating habits may be disordered. Adjusting to new eating habits can be difficult.\\nPrognosis\\nOverall, 30-day postoperative risk of death is 0.2 to 1%. Risk is higher in elderly patients and in patients\\nwho have had an open procedure, who are extremely morbidly obese (> 50 kg), or who have established\\norgan failure.

Additionally, the pain itself may function as a stressor, perpetuating a positive feedback loop.\\nIn addition, menopause increases GI symptoms in several disorders including irritable bowel syndrome,\\ninflammatory bowel disease, endometriosis, and nonulcer dyspepsia.\\nEtiology\\nPerhaps 10% of patients have an occult physiologic illness (see\\nTable 7-1); the remainder have a functional process. However, determining whether a particular\\nabnormality (eg, adhesions, ovarian cyst, endometriosis) is the cause of CAP symptoms or an incidental\\nfinding can be difficult.\\nEvaluation\\nHistory: History of present illness should elicit pain location, quality, duration, timing and frequency of\\nrecurrence, and factors that worsen or relieve pain (particularly eating or moving bowels).

Some findings suggestive of\\nspecific disorders are listed in Table 7-1.\\nFunctional CAP may result in pain similar to that of physiologic origin. However, there are no associated\\nred flag findings, and psychosocial features are often prominent. A history of physical or sexual abuse or\\nan unresolved loss (eg, divorce, miscarriage, or death of a family member) may be a clue.\\nThe Rome criteria for diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome are the presence of abdominal pain or\\ndiscomfort for at least 3 days/mo in the last 3 mo along with at least 2 of the following: (1) improvement\\nwith defecation; (2) onset (of each episode of discomfort) associated with a change in frequency of\\ndefecation; and (3) change in consistency of stool.\\nTesting: In general, simple tests (including urinalysis, CBC, liver tests, ESR, amylase, and lipase) should\\nbe done. Abnormalities in these tests, the presence of red flag findings, or specific clinical findings\\nmandate further testing, even if previous assessments have been negative. Specific tests depend on the\\nfindings (see Table 7-1) but typically include CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast, upper GI\\nendoscopy or colonoscopy, and perhaps small-bowel x-rays or stool testing.\\nThe benefits of testing patients with no red flag findings are unclear. Those > 50 should probably have a\\ncolonoscopy; those ≤ 50 can be observed or have CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast if an\\nimaging study is desired. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), ERCP, and', 'laparoscopy are rarely helpful in the absence of specific indications.\\nBetween the initial evaluation and the follow-up visit, the patient (or family, if the patient is a child) should\\nrecord any pain, including\\n[Table 7-1.

These\\nmeasures rest on a foundation of a trusting, empathic relationship among the physician, patient, and\\nfamily. Patients should be reassured that they are not in danger; specific concerns should be sought and\\naddressed. The physician should explain the laboratory findings and the nature of the problem and\\ndescribe how the pain is generated and how the patient perceives it (ie, that there is a constitutional\\ntendency to feel pain at times of stress). It is important to avoid perpetuating the negative psychosocial\\nconsequences of chronic pain (eg, prolonged absences from school or work, withdrawal from social\\nactivities) and to promote independence, social participation, and self-reliance. These strategies help the\\npatient control or tolerate the symptoms while participating fully in everyday activities.\\nDrugs such as aspirin, NSAIDs, H2 receptor blockers, proton pump inhibitors, and tricyclic\\nantidepressants can be effective. Opioids should be avoided because they invariably lead to dependency.\\nCognitive methods (eg, relaxation training, biofeedback, hypnosis) may help by contributing to the\\npatient's sense of well-being and control. Regular follow-up visits should be scheduled weekly, monthly, or\\nbimonthly, depending on the patient's needs, and should continue until well after the problem has\\nresolved. Psychiatric referral may be required if symptoms persist, especially if the patient is depressed\\nor there are significant psychologic difficulties in the family.\\nSchool personnel should become involved for children who have CAP. Children can rest briefly in the\\nnurse's office during the school day, with the expectation that they return to class after 15 to 30 min.

Approach to the Patient With Lower GI Complaints\\nIntroduction\\nLower GI complaints include constipation, diarrhea, gas and bloating, abdominal pain (see also p. 105),\\nand rectal pain or bleeding (see Ch. 21). As with upper GI complaints, lower GI complaints result from\\nphysiologic illness or represent a functional disorder (ie, no radiologic, biochemical, or pathologic\\nabnormalities found even after extensive evaluation). The reasons for functional symptoms are not clear.\\nEvidence suggests that patients with functional symptoms may have disturbances of motility, nociception,\\nor both; ie, they perceive as uncomfortable certain sensations (eg, luminal distention, peristalsis) that\\nother people do not find distressing.\\nNo bodily function is more variable and subject to external influences than defecation. Bowel habits vary\\nconsiderably from person to person and are affected by age, physiology, diet, and social and cultural\\ninfluences. Some people have unwarranted preoccupation with bowel habits. In Western society, normal\\nstool frequency ranges from 2 to 3/day to 2 to 3/wk. Changes in stool frequency, consistency, volume, or\\ncomposition (ie, presence of blood, mucus, pus, or excess fatty material) may indicate disease.\\nConstipation\\nConstipation is difficult or infrequent passage of stool, hardness of stool, or a feeling of incomplete\\nevacuation.\\nMany people incorrectly believe that daily defecation is necessary and complain of constipation if stools\\noccur less frequently. Others are concerned with the appearance (size, shape, color) or consistency of\\nstools. Sometimes the major complaint is dissatisfaction with the act of defecation or the sense of\\nincomplete evacuation after defecation. Constipation is blamed for many complaints (abdominal pain,\\nnausea, fatigue, anorexia) that are actually symptoms of an underlying problem (eg, irritable bowel\\nsyndrome [IBS], depression). Patients should not expect all symptoms to be relieved by a daily bowel\\nmovement, and measures to aid bowel habits should be used judiciously.\\nObsessive-compulsive patients often feel the need to rid the body daily of \"unclean\" wastes. Such', 'patients often spend excessive time on the toilet or become chronic users of cathartics.\\nEtiology\\nAcute constipation suggests an organic cause, whereas chronic constipation may be organic or functional\\n(see\\nTable 8-1).\\nIn many patients, constipation is associated with sluggish movement of stool through the colon. This\\ndelay may be due to drugs, organic conditions, or a disorder of defecatory function (ie, pelvic floor\\ndysfunction). Patients with disordered defecation do not generate adequate rectal propulsive forces, do\\nnot relax the puborectalis and the external anal sphincter during defecation, or both. In IBS, patients have\\nsymptoms (eg, abdominal discomfort and altered bowel habits) but generally normal colonic transit and\\nanorectal functions. However, IBS-disordered defecation may coexist.\\nExcessive straining, perhaps secondary to pelvic floor dysfunctions, may contribute to anorectal\\npathology (eg, hemorrhoids, anal fissures, and rectal prolapse) and possibly even to syncope. Fecal\\nimpaction, which may cause or develop from constipation, is also common among elderly patients,\\nparticularly with prolonged bed rest or decreased physical activity. It is also common after barium has\\nbeen given by mouth or enema.\\nChanges with aging: Constipation is common among elderly people because of low-fiber diets, lack of\\nexercise, coexisting medical conditions, and use of constipating drugs. Many elderly people have\\nmisconceptions about normal bowel habits and use laxatives regularly. Other changes that predispose the\\nelderly to constipation include increased rectal compliance and impaired rectal sensation (such that larger\\nrectal volumes are needed to elicit the desire to defecate).\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition\\nChapter 8.

Some patients deny previous constipation\\n[Table 8-1. Causes of Constipation]\\nbut, when questioned specifically, admit to spending 15 to 20 min per bowel movement. The presence,\\namount, and duration of blood in the stool should also be elicited.\\nSymptoms of metabolic (eg, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus) and neurologic (eg, spinal cord injury)\\ndisorders and systemic symptoms (eg, weight loss) should also be sought. Prescription and\\nnonprescription drug use should be assessed, with specific questioning about anticholinergic and opioid\\ndrugs.\\nPhysical examination: A general examination is done to look for signs of systemic disease, including\\nfever and cachexia. Abdominal masses should be sought by palpation. A rectal examination should be\\ndone not only for fissures, strictures, blood, or masses (including fecal impaction) but also to evaluate\\nanal resting tone (the puborectalis \"lift\" when patients squeeze the anal sphincter), perineal descent\\nduring simulated evacuation, and rectal sensation. Patients with defecatory disorders may have increased\\nanal resting tone (or anismus), reduced (ie, < 2 cm) or increased (ie, > 4 cm) perineal descent, and/or\\nparadoxical contraction of the puborectalis during simulated evacuation.\\nRed flags: Certain findings raise suspicion of a more serious etiology of chronic constipation:\\n• Distended, tympanitic abdomen\\n• Vomiting\\n• Blood in stool\\n• Weight loss\\n• Severe constipation of recent onset/worsening in elderly patients\\nInterpretation of findings: Certain symptoms (eg, a sense of anorectal blockage, prolonged or difficult\\ndefecation), particularly when associated with abnormal (ie, increased or reduced) perineal motion during\\nsimulated evacuation, suggest a defecatory disorder. A tense, distended, tympanitic abdomen, particularly', 'when there is nausea and vomiting, suggests mechanical obstruction.\\nPatients with IBS typically have abdominal pain with disordered bowel habits (see p. 162). Chronic\\nconstipation with modest abdominal discomfort in a patient who has used laxatives for a long time\\nsuggests slow-transit constipation. Acute constipation coincident with the start of a constipating drug in\\npatients without red flag findings suggests the drug is the cause. New-onset constipation that persists for\\nweeks or occurs intermittently with increasing frequency or severity, in the absence of a known cause,\\nsuggests colonic tumor or other causes of partial obstruction. Excessive straining or prolonged or\\nunsatisfactory defecation, with or without anal digitation, suggests a defecatory disorder. Patients with\\nfecal impaction may have cramps and may pass watery mucus or fecal material around the impacted\\nmass, mimicking diarrhea (paradoxic diarrhea).\\nTesting: Testing is guided by clinical presentation.\\nConstipation with a clear etiology (drugs, trauma, bed rest) may be treated symptomatically without further\\nstudy. Patients with symptoms of bowel obstruction require flat and upright abdominal x-rays, possibly a\\nwater-soluble contrast enema to evaluate for colonic obstruction, and possibly a CT scan or barium x-ray\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition\\nChapter 8.

If the primary complaint is infrequent defecation, colonic\\ntransit times should be measured with radiopaque markers or scintigraphy. If the primary complaint is\\ndifficulty with defecation, anorectal manometry and rectal balloon expulsion should be assessed.\\nTreatment\\n• Possibly discontinuation of causative drugs (some may be necessary)\\n• Increase in dietary fiber\\n• Possibly trial with a brief course of osmotic laxatives\\nAny identified conditions should be treated.\\nAgents used to treat constipation are summarized in\\nTable 8-2. Laxatives should be used judiciously. Some (eg, phosphate, bran, cellulose) bind drugs and\\ninterfere with absorption. Rapid fecal transit may rush some drugs and nutrients beyond their optimal\\nabsorptive locus. Contraindications to laxative and cathartic use include acute abdominal pain of\\nunknown origin, inflammatory bowel disorders, intestinal obstruction, GI bleeding, and fecal impaction.\\nDiet and behavior: The diet should contain enough fiber (typically 15 to 20 g/day) to ensure adequate\\nstool bulk. Vegetable fiber, which is largely indigestible and unabsorbable, increases stool bulk. Certain\\ncomponents of fiber also absorb fluid, making stools softer and facilitating their passage. Fruits and\\nvegetables are recommended sources, as are cereals containing bran. Fiber supplementation is\\nparticularly effective in treating normal-transit constipation but is not very effective for slow-transit\\nconstipation or defecatory disorders.\\n[Table 8-2. Agents Used to Treat Constipation]\\nBehavioral changes may help. Patients should try to move their bowels at the same time daily, preferably\\n15 to 45 min after breakfast, because food ingestion stimulates colonic motility. Initial efforts at regular,\\nunhurried bowel movements may be aided by glycerin suppositories.', 'unhurried bowel movements may be aided by glycerin suppositories.\\nExplanation is important, but it is difficult to convince obsessive-compulsive patients that their attitude\\ntoward defecation is abnormal. Physicians must explain that daily bowel movements are not essential,\\nthat the bowel must be given a chance to function, and that frequent use of laxatives or enemas (> once/3\\ndays) denies the bowel that chance.\\nTypes of laxatives: Bulking agents (eg, psyllium, Ca polycarbophil, methylcellulose) act slowly and\\ngently and are the safest agents for promoting elimination. Proper use involves gradually increasing the\\ndose—ideally taken tid or qid with sufficient liquid (eg, 500 mL/day of extra fluid) to prevent impaction\\n—until a softer, bulkier stool results. Bloating may be reduced by gradually titrating the dose of dietary\\nfiber to the recommended dose, or by switching to a synthetic fiber preparation such as methylcellulose.\\nOsmotic agents contain poorly absorbed polyvalent ions (eg, Mg, phosphate, sulfate), polymers (eg,\\npolyethylene glycol), or carbohydrates (eg, lactulose, sorbitol) that remain in the bowel, increasing\\nintraluminal osmotic pressure and thereby drawing water into the intestine. The increased volume\\nstimulates peristalsis. These agents usually work within 3 h.\\nIn general, osmotic laxatives are reasonably safe even when used regularly. However, Na phosphate\\nshould not be used for bowel cleansing because it may rarely cause acute renal failure even after a single\\nuse for bowel preparation. These events occurred primarily in elderly patients, those with preexisting\\nrenal disease, and those who were taking drugs that affect renal perfusion or function (eg, diuretics, ACE\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition\\nChapter 8.

Also, Mg and phosphate are partially absorbed and may be\\ndetrimental in some conditions (eg, renal insufficiency). Na (in some preparations) may exacerbate heart\\nfailure. In large or frequent doses, these drugs may upset fluid and electrolyte balance. Another approach\\nto cleansing the bowel for diagnostic tests or surgery or sometimes for chronic constipation uses large\\nvolumes of a balanced osmotic agent (eg, polyethylene glycol-electrolyte solution) given orally or via\\nNGT.\\nSecretory or stimulant cathartics (eg, phenolphthalein, bisacodyl, anthraquinones, castor oil,\\nanthraquinones) act by irritating the intestinal mucosa or by directly stimulating the submucosal and\\nmyenteric plexus. Although phenolphthalein was withdrawn from the US market after animal studies\\nsuggested the compound was carcinogenic, there is no epidemiologic evidence of this in humans.\\nBisacodyl is an effective rescue drug for chronic constipation. The anthraquinones senna, cascara\\nsagrada, aloe, and rhubarb are common constituents of herbal and OTC laxatives. They pass unchanged\\nto the colon where bacterial metabolism converts them to active forms. Adverse effects include allergic\\nreactions, electrolyte depletion, melanosis coli, and cathartic colon. Melanosis coli is a brownish black\\ncolorectal pigmentation of unknown composition. Cathartic colon refers to alterations in colonic anatomy\\nobserved on barium enema in patients with chronic stimulant laxative use. It is unclear whether cathartic\\ncolon, which has been attributed to destruction of myenteric plexus neurons by anthraquinones, is caused\\nby currently available agents or other neurotoxic agents (eg, podophyllin), which are no longer available.\\nThere does not seem to be an increased risk of colon cancer with long-term anthraquinone use.\\nEnemas can be used, including tap water and commercially prepared hypertonic solutions.', 'Enemas can be used, including tap water and commercially prepared hypertonic solutions.\\nEmollient agents (eg, docusate, mineral oil) act slowly to soften stools, making them easier to pass.\\nHowever, they are not potent stimulators of defecation. Docusate is a surfactant, which allows water to\\nenter the fecal mass to soften and increase its bulk.\\nFecal impaction: Fecal impaction is treated initially with enemas of tap water followed by small enemas\\n(100 mL) of commercially prepared hypertonic solutions (eg, Na phosphate). If these do not work, manual\\nfragmentation and disimpaction of the mass is necessary. This procedure is painful, so perirectal and\\nintrarectal application of local anesthetics (eg, lidocaine 5% ointment or dibucaine 1% ointment) is\\nrecommended. Some patients require sedation.\\nKey Points\\n• Drug causes are common (eg, chronic laxative abuse, use of anticholinergic or opioid drugs).\\n• Clinicians should be wary of bowel obstruction when constipation is acute and severe.\\n• Symptomatic treatment is reasonable in the absence of red flag findings and after excluding pelvic floor\\ndysfunction.\\nDyschezia\\n(Disordered Evacuation; Dysfunction of Pelvic Floor or Anal Sphincters; Functional Defecatory Disorders;\\nDyssynergia)\\nDyschezia is difficulty defecating. Patients sense the presence of stool and the need to\\ndefecate but are unable. It results from a lack of coordination of pelvic floor muscles and anal\\nsphincters. Diagnosis requires anorectal testing. Treatment is difficult, but biofeedback may be\\nof benefit.\\nEtiology\\nNormally, when a person tries to defecate, rectal pressure rises in coordination with relaxation of the\\nexternal anal sphincter. This process may be affected by one or more dysfunctions (eg, impaired rectal\\ncontraction, excessive contraction of the abdominal wall, paradoxic anal contraction, failure of anal\\nrelaxation) of unclear etiology. Functional defecatory disorders may manifest at any age. In contrast,\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition\\nChapter 8.

Despite prolonged straining,\\nevacuation is tedious or impossible, frequently even for soft stool or enemas. Patients may complain of\\nanal blockage and may digitally remove stool from their rectum or manually support their perineum or\\nsplint the vagina to evacuate. Actual stool frequency may or may not be decreased.\\nDiagnosis\\nRectal and pelvic examinations may reveal hypertonia of the pelvic floor muscles and anal sphincters.\\nWith bearing down, patients may not demonstrate the expected anal relaxation and perineal descent.\\nWith excessive straining, the anterior rectal wall prolapses into the vagina in patients with impaired anal\\nrelaxation; thus rectoceles are usually a secondary rather than a primary disturbance. Long-standing\\ndyschezia with chronic straining may cause a solitary rectal ulcer or varying degrees of rectal prolapse or\\nexcessive perineal descent or an enterocoele. Anorectal manometry and rectal balloon expulsion,\\noccasionally supplemented by defecatory or magnetic resonance proctography, are necessary to\\ndiagnose the condition.\\nTreatment\\nBecause treatment with laxatives is unsatisfactory, it is important to assess anorectal functions in patients\\nwith refractory constipation. Biofeedback therapy can improve coordination between abdominal\\ncontraction and pelvic floor relaxation during defecation, thereby alleviating symptoms. However, pelvic\\nfloor retraining for defecatory disorders is highly specialized and available at select centers only. A\\ncollaborative approach (physiotherapists, dietitians, behavior therapists, gastroenterologists) is\\nnecessary.\\nDiarrhea\\n(See also Chs. 17 and 19. For diarrhea in children, see p. 2737.)\\nStool is 60 to 90% water. In Western society, stool amount is 100 to 200 g/day in healthy adults and 10\\ng/kg/day in infants, depending on the amount of unabsorbable dietary material (mainly carbohydrates).\\nDiarrhea is defined as stool weight > 200 g/day. However, many people consider any increased stool\", 'fluidity to be diarrhea. Alternatively, many people who ingest fiber have bulkier but formed stools but do\\nnot consider themselves to have diarrhea.\\nComplications: Complications may result from diarrhea of any etiology. Fluid loss with consequent\\ndehydration, electrolyte loss (Na, K, Mg, Cl), and even vascular collapse sometimes occur. Collapse can\\ndevelop rapidly in patients who have severe diarrhea (eg, patients with cholera) or are very young, very\\nold, or debilitated. HCO3 loss can cause metabolic acidosis. Hypokalemia can occur when patients have\\nsevere or chronic diarrhea or if the stool contains excess mucus. Hypomagnesemia after prolonged\\ndiarrhea can cause tetany.\\nEtiology\\nNormally, the small intestine and colon absorb 99% of fluid resulting from oral intake and GI tract\\nsecretions—a total fluid load of about 9 of 10 L daily. Thus, even small reductions (ie, 1%) in intestinal\\nwater absorption or increases in secretion can increase water content enough to cause diarrhea.\\nThere are a number of causes of diarrhea (see\\nTable 8-3). Several basic mechanisms are responsible for most clinically significant diarrheas: increased\\nosmotic load, increased secretions, and decreased contact time/surface area. In many disorders, more\\nthan one mechanism is active. For example, diarrhea in inflammatory bowel disease results from mucosal\\ndestruction, exudation into the lumen, and from multiple secretagogues and bacterial toxins that affect\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition\\nChapter 8.

Some Causes of Diarrhea*]\\nOsmotic load: Diarrhea occurs when unabsorbable, water-soluble solutes remain in the bowel and\\nretain water. Such solutes include polyethylene glycol, Mg salts (hydroxide and sulfate), and Na\\nphosphate, which are used as laxatives. Osmotic diarrhea occurs with sugar intolerance (eg, lactose\\nintolerance caused by lactase deficiency). Ingesting large amounts of hexitols (eg, sorbitol, mannitol,\\nxylitol) or high fructose corn syrups, which are used as sugar substitutes in candy, gum, and fruit juices,\\ncauses osmotic diarrhea because hexitols are poorly absorbed. Lactulose, which is used as a laxative,\\ncauses diarrhea by a similar mechanism. Overingesting certain foodstuffs (see\\nTable 8-4) can cause osmotic diarrhea.\\nIncreased secretions: Diarrhea occurs when the bowels secrete more electrolytes and water than they\\nabsorb. Causes of increased secretions include infections, unabsorbed fats, certain drugs, and various\\nintrinsic and extrinsic secretagogues.\\nInfections (eg, gastroenteritis; discussed in Ch. 16) are the most common causes of secretory diarrhea.\\nInfections combined with food poisoning are the most common causes of acute diarrhea (< 4 days in\\nduration). Most enterotoxins block Na+-H+ exchange, which is an important driving force for fluid\\nabsorption in the small bowel and colon.\\nUnabsorbed dietary fat and bile acids (as in malabsorption syndromes and after ileal resection) can\\nstimulate colonic secretion and cause diarrhea.\\nDrugs may stimulate intestinal secretions directly (eg, quinidine, quinine, colchicine, anthraquinone\\ncathartics, castor oil, prostaglandins) or indirectly by impairing fat absorption (eg, orlistat).\\nVarious endocrine tumors produce secretagogues, including vipomas (vasoactive intestinal peptide),', 'gastrinomas (gastrin), mastocytosis (histamine), medullary carcinoma of the thyroid (calcitonin and\\nprostaglandins), and carcinoid tumors (histamine, serotonin, and polypeptides). Some of these mediators\\n(eg, prostaglandins, serotonin, related compounds) also accelerate intestinal transit, colonic transit, or\\nboth.\\nReduced contact time/surface area: Rapid intestinal transit and diminished surface area impair fluid\\nabsorption and cause diarrhea. Common causes include small-bowel or large-bowel resection or bypass,\\ngastric resection,\\n[Table 8-4. Dietary Factors that May Worsen Diarrhea]\\nand inflammatory bowel disease. Other causes include microscopic colitis (collagenous or lymphocytic\\ncolitis) and celiac sprue.\\nStimulation of intestinal smooth muscle by drugs (eg, Mg-containing antacids, laxatives, cholinesterase\\ninhibitors, SSRIs) or humoral agents (eg, prostaglandins, serotonin) also can speed transit.\\nEvaluation\\nHistory: Duration and severity of diarrhea, circumstances of onset (including recent travel, food\\ningested, source of water), drug use (including any antibiotics within the previous 3 mo), abdominal pain\\nor vomiting, frequency and timing of bowel movements, changes in stool characteristics (eg, presence of\\nblood, pus, or mucus; changes in color or consistency; evidence of steatorrhea), associated changes in\\nweight or appetite, and rectal urgency or tenesmus should be noted. Simultaneous occurrence of\\ndiarrhea in close contacts should be ascertained.\\nPhysical examination: Fluid and hydration status should be evaluated.

Acute bloody diarrhea with or without hemodynamic instability in an otherwise healthy person\\nsuggests an enteroinvasive infection. Diverticular bleeding and ischemic colitis also manifest with acute\\nbloody diarrhea. Recurrent bouts of bloody diarrhea in a younger person suggest inflammatory bowel\\ndisease.

Infants 2 to 4 mo of age with recurrent crying spells often appear to observers to be in pain,\\nwhich in the past has been attributed to abdominal cramping or gas and termed colic. However, studies\\nshow no increase in H2 production or in mouth-to-cecum transit times in colicky infants. Hence, the cause\\nof infantile colic remains unclear (see p. 2725).\\nExcessive belching: Belching (eructation) results from swallowed air or from gas generated by\\ncarbonated beverages. Aerophagia occurs normally in small amounts during eating and drinking, but\\nsome people unconsciously swallow air repeatedly while eating or smoking and at other times, especially\\nwhen anxious or in an attempt to induce belching. Excessive salivation increases aerophagia and may be\\nassociated with various GI disorders (eg, gastroesophageal reflux disease), ill-fitting dentures, certain\\ndrugs, gum chewing, or nausea of any cause.\\nMost swallowed air is eructated. Only a small amount of swallowed air passes into the small bowel; the\\namount is apparently influenced by position. In an upright person, air is readily belched; in a supine\\nperson, air trapped above the stomach fluid tends to be propelled into the duodenum. Excessive\\neructation may also be voluntary; patients who belch after taking antacids may attribute the relief of\\nsymptoms to belching rather than to antacids and may intentionally belch to relieve distress.\\nDistention (bloating): Abdominal bloating may occur in isolation or along with other GI symptoms in\\npatients with functional disorders (eg, aerophagia, nonulcer dyspepsia, gastroparesis, irritable bowel\\nsyndrome) or organic disorders (eg, ovarian cancer, colon cancer). However, excessive intestinal gas is\\nnot clearly linked to these complaints. In most healthy people, 1 L/h of gas can be infused into the gut', 'with minimal symptoms. It is likely that many symptoms are incorrectly attributed to \"too much gas.\"\\nOn the other hand, some patients with recurrent GI symptoms often cannot tolerate small quantities of\\ngas: Retrograde colonic distention by balloon inflation or air instillation during colonoscopy often elicits\\nsevere discomfort in some patients (eg, those with irritable bowel syndrome) but minimal symptoms in\\nothers. Similarly, patients with eating disorders (eg, anorexia nervosa, bulimia) often misperceive and are\\nparticularly stressed by symptoms such as bloating. Thus, the basic abnormality in patients with gas-\\nrelated symptoms may be a hypersensitive intestine. Altered motility may contribute further to symptoms.\\nExcessive flatus: There is great variability in the quantity and frequency of rectal gas passage. As with\\nstool frequency, people who complain of flatulence often have a misconception of what is normal. The\\naverage number of gas passages is about 13 to 21/day. Objectively recording flatus frequency (using a\\ndiary kept by the patient) is a first step in evaluation.\\nFlatus is a metabolic byproduct of intestinal bacteria; almost none originates from swallowed air or back-\\ndiffusion of gases (primarily N2) from the bloodstream. Bacterial metabolism yields significant volumes of\\nH2, CH4, and CO2.\\nH2 is produced in large quantities in patients with malabsorption syndromes and after ingestion of certain\\nfruits and vegetables containing indigestible carbohydrates (eg, baked beans), sugars (eg, fructose), or\\nsugar alcohols (eg, sorbitol). In patients with disaccharidase deficiencies (most commonly lactase\\ndeficiency), large amounts of disaccharides pass into the colon and are fermented to H2. Celiac disease,\\ntropical sprue, pancreatic insufficiency, and other causes of carbohydrate malabsorption should also be\\nconsidered in cases of excess colonic gas.\\nCH4 is also produced by colonic bacterial metabolism of the same foods (eg, dietary fiber). However,\\nabout 10% of people have bacteria that produce CH4 but not H2.', 'about 10% of people have bacteria that produce CH4 but not H2.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition\\nChapter 8.

The acid products released by bacterial fermentation of\\nunabsorbed carbohydrates in the colon may also react with HCO3- to produce CO2. Although bloating\\nmay occasionally occur, the rapid diffusion of CO2 into the blood generally prevents distention.\\n[Table 8-5. Some Causes of Gas-Related Complaints]\\nDiet accounts for much of the variation in flatus production among individuals, but poorly understood\\nfactors (eg, differences in colonic flora and motility) may also play a role.\\nDespite the flammable nature of the H2 and CH4 in flatulence, working near open flames is not\\nhazardous.

Diagnostic and Therapeutic GI Procedures\\nIntroduction\\nDiagnostic tests and therapeutic procedures available for patients with GI disorders include acid-related\\ntests, endoscopy, laparoscopy, manometry, nuclear scans, x-ray contrast studies, nasogastric or intestinal\\nintubation, anoscopy and sigmoidoscopy, abdominal paracentesis, electrogastrography, and electrical\\nimpedance testing. CT, MRI, and ultrasonography are also commonly done for GI disorders, and\\nsometimes angiography is used. The selection of procedures is discussed in subsequent chapters.\\nERCP, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography, and liver biopsy are discussed in Ch. 24.\\nAcid-Related Tests\\nAcid-related tests are used to ascertain the effectiveness of acid-blocking drugs. All require nasogastric or\\nnasoesophageal intubation. Complications are very rare. Patients must have nothing by mouth (npo) after\\nmidnight.\\nAmbulatory pH Monitoring\\nAmbulatory 24-h esophageal pH monitoring is currently the best available test for quantifying esophageal\\nacid exposure. The principal indications are\\n• To document excessive acid exposure in patients without endoscopic evidence of esophagitis\\n• To evaluate the effectiveness of medical or surgical treatments\\nA thin tube containing a pH probe is positioned 5 cm above the lower esophageal sphincter. The patient\\nrecords symptoms, meals, and sleep for 24 h. Esophageal acid exposure is defined by the percentage of\\nthe 24-h recording time that the pH is < 4.0. Values > 3.5% are considered abnormal. However, symptoms\\nmay not correlate with acid exposure or the presence of esophagitis. This may be because symptoms\\nmay result from nonacidic as well as acidic refluxate. Multichannel intraluminal impedance testing allows\\nfor recognition of major acid, minor acid, nonacid, and gas reflux, all of which can cause reflux symptoms.\\nGastric Analysis\\nSamples of stomach contents obtained via NGT are used to measure gastric acid output in a basal and\\nstimulated state. This information may be useful in a patient who develops a recurrent ulcer after surgical', \"stimulated state. This information may be useful in a patient who develops a recurrent ulcer after surgical\\nvagotomy for peptic ulcer disease. In this case, a positive acid response to stimulation (sham feeding)\\nindicates an incomplete vagotomy. The test also is used to evaluate a patient with elevated serum gastrin\\nlevels. Hyperchlorhydria in the presence of elevated gastrin usually indicates Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.\\nHypochlorhydria in the presence of elevated gastrin indicates impairment of acid output, such as occurs\\nin pernicious anemia, atrophic gastritis, and Menetrier's disease and after inhibition of gastric acid\\nsecretion by potent antisecretory drugs.\\nTo do gastric analysis, an NGT is inserted and the gastric contents are aspirated and discarded. Gastric\\njuice is then collected for 1 h, divided into four 15-min samples. These samples represent basal acid\\noutput.\\nEndoscopy\\nFlexible endoscopes equipped with video cameras can be used to view the upper GI tract from pharynx to\\nupper duodenum and the lower GI tract from anus to cecum (and, sometimes, terminal ileum). Several\\nother diagnostic and therapeutic interventions also can be done endoscopically. The potential to combine\\ndiagnosis and therapy in one procedure gives endoscopy a significant advantage over procedures that\\nprovide only imaging (eg, x-ray contrast studies, CT, MRI) and often outweighs endoscopy's higher cost\\nand need for sedation.\\nDiagnostic procedures include the use of ultrasound-equipped endoscopes to evaluate blood flow or\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition\\nChapter 9.

CT colonography (see p. 98) is an alternative to colonoscopy for screening for colonic\\ntumors.\\nTherapeutic endoscopic procedures include removal of foreign bodies; hemostasis by thermal\\ncoagulation, laser photocoagulation, variceal banding, or sclerotherapy; debulking of tumors by laser or\\nbipolar electrocoagulation; dilation of webs or strictures; stent placement; reduction of volvulus or\\nintussusception; and decompression of acute or subacute colonic dilatation.\\nAbsolute contraindications to endoscopy include\\n• Shock\\n• Acute MI\\n• Peritonitis\\n• Acute perforation\\n• Fulminant colitis\\nRelative contraindications include poor patient cooperation, coma (unless the patient is intubated), and\\ncardiac arrhythmias or recent myocardial ischemia.\\nPatients taking anticoagulants or chronic NSAID therapy can safely undergo diagnostic endoscopy.\\nHowever, if there is a possibility that biopsy or photocoagulation will be done, these drugs should be\\nstopped for an appropriate interval before the procedure. Oral iron-containing drugs should be stopped 4\\nto 5 days before colonoscopy, because certain green vegetables interact with iron to form a sticky residue\\nthat is difficult to remove with a bowel preparation and interferes with visualization. The American Heart\\nAssociation no longer recommends endocarditis prophylaxis for patients having GI endoscopy.\\nRoutine preparations for endoscopy include no solids for 6 to 8 h and no liquids for 4 h before the\\nprocedure. Additionally, colonoscopy requires cleansing of the colon. A variety of regimens may be used,\\nbut all typically include a full or clear liquid diet for 24 to 48 h and some type of laxative, with or without an', 'enema. A common laxative preparation involves having the patient drink a high-volume (4 L) balanced\\nelectrolyte solution over a period of 3 to 4 h before the procedure.

GI Bleeding\\nIntroduction\\nGI bleeding can originate anywhere from the mouth to the anus and can be overt or occult. The\\nmanifestations depend on the location and rate of bleeding.\\nHematemesis is vomiting of red blood and indicates upper GI bleeding, usually from an arterial source or\\nvarix. Coffee-ground emesis is vomiting of dark brown, granular material that resembles coffee grounds. It\\nresults from upper GI bleeding that has slowed or stopped, with conversion of red Hb to brown hematin\\nby gastric acid.\\nHematochezia is the passage of gross blood from the rectum and usually indicates lower GI bleeding but\\nmay result from vigorous upper GI bleeding with rapid transit of blood through the intestines.\\nMelena is black, tarry stool and typically indicates upper GI bleeding, but bleeding from a source in the\\nsmall bowel or right colon may also be the cause. About 100 to 200 mL of blood in the upper GI tract is\\nrequired to cause melena, which may persist for several days after bleeding has ceased. Black stool that\\ndoes not contain occult blood may result from ingestion of iron, bismuth, or various foods and should not\\nbe mistaken for melena.\\nChronic occult bleeding can occur from anywhere in the GI tract and is detectable by chemical testing of a\\nstool specimen. Acute, severe bleeding also can occur from anywhere in the GI tract. Patients may\\npresent with signs of shock. Those with underlying ischemic heart disease may develop angina or MI\\nbecause of hypoperfusion.\\nGI bleeding may precipitate portal-systemic encephalopathy (see p. 220) or hepatorenal syndrome\\n(kidney failure secondary to liver failure—see p. 223).\\nEtiology\\nThere are many possible causes (see\\nTable 10-1), which are divided into upper GI (above the ligament of Treitz), lower GI, and small bowel.\\nBleeding of any cause is more likely, and potentially more severe, in patients with chronic liver disease\\n(eg, caused by alcohol abuse or chronic hepatitis), in those with hereditary coagulation disorders, or in\\nthose taking certain drugs. Drugs associated with GI bleeding include anticoagulants (eg, heparin,\\nwarfarin), those affecting platelet function (eg, aspirin and certain other NSAIDs, clopidogrel, SSRIs), and', 'those affecting mucosal defenses (eg, NSAIDs).\\nEvaluation\\nStabilization with airway management, IV fluids, or transfusions is essential before and during diagnostic\\nevaluation.\\nHistory: History of present illness should attempt to ascertain quantity and frequency of blood\\npassage. However, quantity can be difficult to assess because even small amounts (5 to 10 mL) of blood\\nturn water in a toilet bowl an opaque red, and modest amounts of vomited blood appear huge to an\\nanxious patient. However, most can distinguish among blood streaks, a few teaspoons, and clots.\\nPatients with hematemesis should be asked whether blood was passed with initial vomiting or only after\\nan initial (or several) nonbloody emesis.\\nPatients with rectal bleeding should be asked whether pure blood was passed; whether it was mixed with\\nstool, pus, or mucus; or whether blood simply coated the stool. Those with bloody diarrhea should be\\nasked about travel or other possible exposure to GI pathogens.\\n[Table 10-1.

Patients with lesser degrees of bleeding may simply have mild tachycardia (heart rate >\\n100). Orthostatic changes in pulse (a change of > 10 beats/min) or BP (a drop of ≥ 10 mm Hg) often\\ndevelop after acute loss of ≥ 2 units of blood.

Acute Abdomen and Surgical Gastroenterology\\nIntroduction\\nAcute abdomen refers to abdominal symptoms and signs of such severity or concern that disorders\\nrequiring surgery should be considered. The primary symptom is acute abdominal pain. Chronic\\nabdominal pain is discussed in Ch. 7.\\nAcute Abdominal Pain\\nAbdominal pain is common and often inconsequential. Acute and severe abdominal pain, however, is\\nalmost always a symptom of intra-abdominal disease. It may be the sole indicator of the need for surgery\\nand must be attended to swiftly: Gangrene and perforation of the gut can occur < 6 h from onset of\\nsymptoms in certain conditions (eg, interruption of the intestinal blood supply caused by a strangulating\\nobstruction or an arterial embolus). Abdominal pain is of particular concern in patients who are very young\\nor very old and those who have HIV infection or are taking immunosuppressants.\\nTextbook descriptions of abdominal pain have limitations because people react to pain differently. Some,\\nparticularly elderly people, are stoic, whereas others exaggerate their symptoms. Infants, young children,\\nand some elderly people may have difficulty localizing the pain.\\nPathophysiology\\nVisceral pain comes from the abdominal viscera, which are innervated by autonomic nerve fibers and\\nrespond mainly to the sensations of distention and muscular contraction—not to cutting, tearing, or local\\nirritation. Visceral pain is typically vague, dull, and nauseating. It is poorly localized and tends to be\\nreferred to areas corresponding to the embryonic origin of the affected structure. Foregut structures\\n(stomach, duodenum, liver, and pancreas) cause upper abdominal pain. Midgut structures (small bowel,\\nproximal colon, and appendix) cause periumbilical pain. Hindgut structures (distal colon and GU tract)\\ncause lower abdominal pain.\\nSomatic pain comes from the parietal peritoneum, which is innervated by somatic nerves, which respond\\nto irritation from infectious, chemical, or other inflammatory processes. Somatic pain is sharp and well\\nlocalized.\\nReferred pain is pain perceived distant from its source and results from convergence of nerve fibers at\\nthe spinal cord. Common examples of referred pain are scapular pain due to biliary colic, groin pain due', \"to renal colic, and shoulder pain due to blood or infection irritating the diaphragm.\\nPeritonitis: Peritonitis is inflammation of the peritoneal cavity. The most serious cause is perforation of\\nthe GI tract (see p. 111), which causes immediate chemical inflammation followed shortly by infection from\\nintestinal organisms. Peritonitis can also result from any abdominal condition that causes marked\\ninflammation (eg, appendicitis, diverticulitis, strangulating intestinal obstruction, pancreatitis, pelvic\\ninflammatory disease, mesenteric ischemia). Intraperitoneal blood from any source (eg, ruptured\\naneurysm, trauma, surgery, ectopic pregnancy) is irritating and results in peritonitis. Barium causes\\nsevere peritonitis and should never be given to a patient with suspected GI tract perforation. Peritoneo-\\nsystemic shunts, drains, and dialysis catheters in the peritoneal cavity predispose a patient to infectious\\nperitonitis, as does ascitic fluid. Rarely, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis occurs, in which the peritoneal\\ncavity is infected by blood-borne bacteria.\\nPeritonitis causes fluid shift into the peritoneal cavity and bowel, leading to severe dehydration and\\nelectrolyte disturbances. Adult respiratory distress syndrome can develop rapidly. Kidney failure, liver\\nfailure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation follow. The patient's face becomes drawn into the\\nmasklike appearance typical of hippocratic facies. Death occurs within days.\\nEtiology\\nMany intra-abdominal disorders cause abdominal pain (see\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition\\nChapter 11.

These include ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), perforated viscus, mesenteric\\nischemia, and ruptured ectopic pregnancy. Others (eg, intestinal obstruction, appendicitis, severe acute\\npancreatitis) are also serious and nearly as urgent. Several extra-abdominal disorders also cause\\nabdominal pain (see\\nTable 11-1).\\nAbdominal pain in neonates, infants, and young children has numerous causes not encountered in adults,\\nincluding meconium peritonitis, pyloric stenosis, esophageal webs, volvulus of a gut with a common\\nmesentery, imperforate anus, intussusception, and intestinal obstruction caused by atresia.\\nEvaluation\\nEvaluation of mild and severe pain follows the same process, although with severe abdominal pain,\\ntherapy sometimes proceeds simultaneously and involves early consultation with a surgeon. History and\\nphysical examination usually exclude all but a few possible causes, with final diagnosis confirmed by\\njudicious use of laboratory and imaging tests. Life-threatening causes should always be ruled out before\\nfocusing on less serious diagnoses. In seriously ill patients with severe abdominal pain, the most\\nimportant diagnostic measure may be expeditious surgical exploration. In mildly ill patients, watchful\\nwaiting may be best.\\nHistory: A thorough history usually suggests the diagnosis (see\\nTable 11-2). Of particular importance are pain location (see Fig. 11-1) and characteristics, history of\\nsimilar symptoms, and associated symptoms. Concomitant symptoms such as gastroesophageal reflux,\\nnausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, jaundice, melena, hematuria, hematemesis, weight loss, and\\nmucus or blood in the stool help direct subsequent evaluation. A drug history should include details\\nconcerning prescription and illicit drug use as well as alcohol. Many drugs cause GI upset. Prednisone or\\nimmunosuppressants may inhibit the inflammatory response to perforation or peritonitis and result in less\\npain and leukocytosis than might otherwise be expected.

Back pain with shock suggests ruptured AAA,\\nparticularly if there is a tender, pulsatile mass. Shock and vaginal bleeding in a pregnant woman suggest\\nruptured ectopic pregnancy. Ecchymoses of the costovertebral angles (Grey Turner's sign) or around the\\numbilicus (Cullen's sign) suggest hemorrhagic pancreatitis but are not very sensitive for this disorder.\\nHistory is often suggestive (see Table 11-2).

It leads to mediator release, inflammation, and ultimately infarction. Abdominal\\npain is out of proportion to physical findings. Early diagnosis is difficult, but angiography and\\nexploratory laparotomy have the most sensitivity; other imaging modalities often become\\npositive only late in the disease. Treatment is by embolectomy, revascularization of viable\\nsegments, or resection; sometimes vasodilator therapy is successful. Mortality is high.\\nPathophysiology\\nThe intestinal mucosa has a high metabolic rate and, accordingly, a high blood flow requirement (normally\\nreceiving 20 to 25% of cardiac output), making it very sensitive to the effects of decreased perfusion.\\nIschemia disrupts the mucosal barrier, allowing release of bacteria, toxins, and vasoactive mediators,\\nwhich in turn leads to myocardial depression, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (see p. 2299),\\nmultisystem organ failure, and death. Mediator release may occur even before complete infarction.\\nNecrosis can occur as soon as 10 to 12 h after the onset of symptoms.\\nThree major vessels serve the abdominal contents: the celiac trunk, the superior mesenteric artery\\n(SMA), and the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). The celiac trunk supplies the esophagus, stomach,\\nproximal duodenum, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, and spleen. The SMA supplies the distal duodenum,\\njejunum, ileum, and colon to the splenic flexure. The IMA supplies the descending colon and sigmoid\\ncolon and the rectum. Collateral vessels are abundant in the stomach, duodenum, and rectum; these\\nareas rarely develop ischemia. The splenic flexure is a watershed between the SMA and IMA and is at\\nparticular risk of ischemia.\\nEtiology', 'particular risk of ischemia.\\nEtiology\\nMesenteric blood flow may be disrupted on either the venous or arterial sides. In general, patients > 50\\nare at greatest risk and have the types of occlusions and risk factors shown in\\nTable 11-3. However, many patients have no identifiable risk factors.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nThe early hallmark of mesenteric ischemia is severe pain but minimal physical findings. The abdomen\\nremains soft, with little or no tenderness. Mild tachycardia may be present. Later, as necrosis develops,\\nsigns of peritonitis appear, with marked abdominal tenderness, guarding, rigidity, and no bowel sounds.\\nThe stool may be heme-positive (increasingly likely as ischemia progresses). The usual signs of shock\\ndevelop and are frequently followed by death.\\nSudden onset of pain suggests but is not diagnostic of an arterial embolism, whereas a more gradual\\nonset is typical of venous thrombosis. Patients with a history of postprandial abdominal discomfort (which\\nsuggests intestinal angina) may have arterial thrombosis.\\n[Table 11-3.

Mesenteric ischemia must be considered in any patient > 50 with known risk factors or\\npredisposing conditions who develops sudden, severe abdominal pain.\\nPatients with clear peritoneal signs should proceed directly to the operating room for both diagnosis and\\ntreatment. For others, selective mesenteric angiography is the diagnostic procedure of choice. Other\\nimaging studies and serum markers can show abnormalities but lack sensitivity and specificity early in the\\ncourse of the disease when diagnosis is most critical. Plain abdominal x-rays are useful mainly in ruling\\nout other causes of pain (eg, perforated viscus), although portal venous gas or pneumatosis intestinalis\\nmay be seen late in the disease. These findings also appear on CT, which may also directly visualize\\nvascular occlusion—more accurately on the venous side. Doppler ultrasonography can sometimes\\nidentify arterial occlusion, but sensitivity is low. MRI is very accurate in proximal vascular occlusion, less\\nso in distal vascular occlusion. Serum markers (eg, creatine kinase, lactate) rise with necrosis but are\\nnonspecific findings that are seen later. Intestinal fatty acid binding protein in the urine may prove\\nvaluable in the future as an early marker.\\nPrognosis\\nIf diagnosis and treatment take place before infarction occurs, mortality is low; after intestinal infarction,\\nmortality approaches 70 to 90%. For this reason, clinical diagnosis of mesenteric ischemia should\\nsupersede diagnostic tests, which may delay treatment.\\nTreatment\\n• Surgical: Embolectomy, revascularization, or resection\\n• Angiographic: Vasodilators or thrombolysis\\n• Long-term anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy\\nIf diagnosis is made during exploratory laparotomy, options are surgical embolectomy, revascularization,\\nand resection. A \"second look\" laparotomy may be needed to reassess the viability of questionable areas\\nof bowel. If diagnosis is made by angiography, infusion of the vasodilator papaverine through the', \"angiography catheter may improve survival in both occlusive and nonocclusive ischemia. A 60-mg bolus is\\ngiven over 2 min, followed by an infusion of 30 to 60 mg/h. Papaverine is useful even when surgical\\nintervention is planned and is sometimes given during and after surgical intervention as well. In addition,\\nfor arterial occlusion, thrombolysis or surgical embolectomy may be done. The development of peritoneal\\nsigns at any time during the evaluation suggests the need for immediate surgery. Mesenteric venous\\nthrombosis without signs of peritonitis can be treated with papaverine followed by anticoagulation with\\nheparin and then warfarin.\\nPatients with arterial embolism or venous thrombosis require long-term anticoagulation with warfarin.\\nPatients with nonocclusive ischemia may be treated with antiplatelet therapy.\\nAcute Perforation\\nAny part of the GI tract may become perforated, releasing gastric or intestinal contents into the\\nperitoneal space.

If the perforation is contained by the omentum, an appendiceal abscess results.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nThe classic symptoms of acute appendicitis are epigastric or periumbilical pain followed by brief nausea,\\nvomiting, and anorexia; after a few hours, the pain shifts to the right lower quadrant. Pain increases with\\ncough and motion. Classic signs are right lower quadrant direct and rebound tenderness located at\\nMcBurney's point (junction of the middle and outer thirds of the line joining the umbilicus to the anterior\\nsuperior spine). Additional signs are pain felt in the right lower quadrant with palpation of the left lower\\nquadrant (Rovsing sign), an increase in pain from passive extension of the right hip joint that stretches\\nthe iliopsoas muscle (psoas sign), or pain caused by passive internal rotation of the flexed thigh\\n(obturator sign).

The surgeon can\\nusually remove the appendix even if perforated. Occasionally, the appendix is difficult to locate: In these\\ncases, it usually lies behind the cecum or the ileum and mesentery of the right colon. A contraindication to\\nappendectomy is inflammatory bowel disease involving the cecum. However, in cases of terminal ileitis\\nand a normal cecum, the appendix should be removed.\\nAppendectomy should be preceded by IV antibiotics. Third-generation cephalosporins are preferred. For\\nnonperforated appendicitis, no further antibiotics are required. If the appendix is perforated, antibiotics\\nshould be continued until the patient's temperature and WBC count have normalized or continued for a\\nfixed course, according to the surgeon's preference. If surgery is impossible, antibiotics—although not\\ncurative—markedly improve the survival rate. When a large inflammatory mass is found involving the\\nappendix, terminal ileum, and cecum, resection of the entire mass and ileocolostomy are preferable. In\\nlate cases in which a pericolic abscess has already formed, the abscess is drained either by an\\nultrasound-guided percutaneous catheter or by open operation (with appendectomy to follow at a later\\ndate). A Meckel's diverticulum in a patient under the age of 40 should be removed concomitantly with the\\nappendectomy unless extensive inflammation around the appendix prevents the procedure.\\nHernias of the Abdominal Wall\\nA hernia of the abdominal wall is a protrusion of the abdominal contents through an acquired or\\ncongenital area of weakness or defect in the wall.

Because the hernia may be apparent only when abdominal pressure is\\nincreased, the patient should be examined in a standing position. If no hernia is palpable, the patient\\nshould cough or perform a Valsalva maneuver as the examiner palpates the abdominal wall. Examination\\nfocuses on the umbilicus, the inguinal area (with a finger in the inguinal canal in males), the femoral\\ntriangle, and any incisions that are present.\\nInguinal masses that resemble hernias may be the result of adenopathy (infectious or malignant), an\\nectopic testis, or lipoma. These masses are solid and are not reducible. A scrotal mass may be a\\nvaricocele, hydrocele, or testicular tumor. Ultrasound may be done if physical examination is equivocal.\\nPrognosis\\nCongenital umbilical hernias rarely strangulate and are not treated; most resolve spontaneously within\\nseveral years. Very large defects may be repaired electively after age 2 yr. Umbilical hernias in adults\\ncause cosmetic concerns and can be electively repaired; strangulation and incarceration are unusual but,\\nif happen, usually contain omentum rather than intestine.\\nTreatment\\n• Surgical repair\\nGroin hernias should be repaired electively because of the risk of strangulation, which results in higher\\nmorbidity (and possible mortality in elderly patients).

Esophageal and Swallowing Disorders\\nIntroduction\\n(See also Esophageal Cancer on p. 186 and Esophageal Atresia on p. 2975.)\\nThe swallowing apparatus consists of the pharynx, upper esophageal (cricopharyngeal) sphincter, the\\nbody of the esophagus, and the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). The upper third of the esophagus\\nand the structures proximal to it are composed of skeletal muscle; the distal esophagus and LES are\\ncomposed of smooth muscle. These components work as an integrated system that transports material\\nfrom the mouth to the stomach and prevents its reflux into the esophagus. Physical obstruction or\\ndisorders that interfere with motor function (motility disorders) can affect the system.\\nThe patient's history suggests the diagnosis almost 80% of the time. The only physical findings in\\nesophageal disorders are cervical and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy caused by metastasis, swellings\\nin the neck caused by large pharyngeal diverticula or thyromegaly, and prolonged swallowing time (the\\ntime from the act of swallowing to the sound of the bolus of fluid and air entering the stomach—normally ≤\\n12 sec—heard by auscultation with the stethoscope over the epigastrium). Watching the patient swallow\\nmay help diagnose aspiration or nasal regurgitation. Most esophageal disorders require specific tests for\\ndiagnosis.\\nDysphagia\\nDysphagia is difficulty swallowing. The condition results from impeded transport of liquids, solids, or both\\nfrom the pharynx to the stomach. Dysphagia should not be confused with globus sensation (see p. 78), a\\nfeeling of having a lump in the throat, which is unrelated to swallowing and occurs without impaired\\ntransport.\\nComplications: Dysphagia can lead to tracheal aspiration of ingested material, oral secretions, or both.\\nAspiration can cause acute pneumonia; recurrent aspiration may eventually lead to chronic lung disease.\\nProlonged dysphagia often leads to inadequate nutrition and weight loss.\\nEtiology\\nDysphagia is classified as oropharyngeal or esophageal, depending on where it occurs.\", 'Oropharyngeal dysphagia: Oropharyngeal dysphagia is difficulty emptying material from the\\noropharynx into the esophagus; it results from abnormal function proximal to the esophagus.

Diagnosis is made by\\nbarium swallow; surgical repair is rarely required.\\nThere are several types of esophageal diverticula, each of different origin.\\n• Zenker's (pharyngeal) diverticula are posterior outpouchings of mucosa and submucosa through the\\ncricopharyngeal muscle, probably resulting from an incoordination between pharyngeal propulsion and\\ncricopharyngeal relaxation.\\n• Midesophageal (traction) diverticula are caused by traction from mediastinal inflammatory lesions or,\\nsecondarily, by motility disorders.\\n• Epiphrenic diverticula occur just above the diaphragm and usually accompany a motility disorder\\n(achalasia, diffuse esophageal spasm).\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nA Zenker's diverticulum fills with food that might be regurgitated when the patient bends or lies down.\\nAspiration pneumonitis may result if regurgitation is nocturnal. Rarely, the pouch becomes large, causing\\ndysphagia and sometimes a palpable neck mass.\\nTraction and epiphrenic diverticula are rarely symptomatic, although their underlying cause may be.\\nDiagnosis\\nAll diverticula are diagnosed by videotaped barium swallow.\\nTreatment\\n• Usually none\\n• Sometimes surgical resection\\nSpecific treatment is usually not required, although resection is occasionally necessary for large or\\nsymptomatic diverticula. Diverticula associated with motility disorders require treatment of the primary\\ndisorder. For example, case reports suggest doing a cricopharyngeal myotomy when resecting a Zenker's\\ndiverticulum.\\nGastroesophageal Reflux Disease\\nIncompetence of the lower esophageal sphincter allows reflux of gastric contents into the\", 'esophagus, causing burning pain. Prolonged reflux may lead to esophagitis, stricture, and rarely\\nmetaplasia or cancer. Diagnosis is clinical, sometimes with endoscopy, with or without acid\\ntesting. Treatment involves lifestyle modification, acid suppression using proton pump\\ninhibitors, and sometimes surgical repair.\\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is common, occurring in 30 to 40% of adults. It also occurs\\nfrequently in infants, typically beginning at birth.\\nEtiology\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition\\nChapter 12.

Transient LES relaxations are triggered by gastric distention or subthreshold\\npharyngeal stimulation.\\nFactors that contribute to the competence of the gastroesophageal junction include the angle of the\\ncardioesophageal junction, the action of the diaphragm, and gravity (ie, an upright position). Factors\\ncontributing to reflux include weight gain, fatty foods, caffeinated or carbonated beverages, alcohol,\\ntobacco smoking, and drugs. Drugs that lower LES pressure include anticholinergics, antihistamines,\\ntricyclic antidepressants, Ca channel blockers, progesterone, and nitrates.\\nComplications: GERD may lead to esophagitis, peptic esophageal ulcer, esophageal stricture, Barrett's\\nesophagus, and esophageal adenocarcinoma (see p. 186). Factors that contribute to the development of\\nesophagitis include the caustic nature of the refluxate, the inability to clear the refluxate from the\\nesophagus, the volume of gastric contents, and local mucosal protective functions. Some patients,\\nparticularly infants, aspirate the reflux material.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nThe most prominent symptom of GERD is heartburn, with or without regurgitation of gastric contents into\\nthe mouth. Infants present with vomiting, irritability, anorexia, and sometimes symptoms of chronic\\naspiration. Both adults and infants with chronic aspiration may have cough, hoarseness, or wheezing.\\nEsophagitis may cause odynophagia and even esophageal hemorrhage, which is usually occult but can\\nbe massive. Peptic stricture causes a gradually progressive dysphagia for solid foods. Peptic esophageal\\nulcers cause the same type of pain as gastric or duodenal ulcers, but the pain is usually localized to the\", \"xiphoid or high substernal region. Peptic esophageal ulcers heal slowly, tend to recur, and usually leave a\\nstricture on healing.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Clinical diagnosis\\n• Endoscopy for those not responding to empiric treatment\\n• 24-h pH testing for those with typical symptoms but normal endoscopy\\nA detailed history points to the diagnosis. Patients with typical symptoms of GERD may be given a trial of\\ntherapy. Patients who do not improve, or have long-standing symptoms or symptoms of complications,\\nshould be studied. Endoscopy, with cytologic washings and biopsy of abnormal areas, is the test of\\nchoice. Endoscopic biopsy is the only test that consistently detects the columnar mucosal changes of\\nBarrett's esophagus. Patients with unremarkable endoscopy findings who have typical symptoms despite\\ntreatment with proton pump inhibitors should undergo 24-h pH testing (see p. 95). Although barium\\nswallow readily shows esophageal ulcers and peptic strictures, it is less useful for mild to moderate reflux;\\nin addition, most patients with abnormalities require subsequent endoscopy. Esophageal manometry may\\nbe used to guide pH probe placement and to evaluate esophageal peristalsis before surgical treatment.\\nTreatment\\n• Head of bed elevated\\n• Coffee, alcohol, fats, and smoking avoided\\n• Proton pump inhibitors\\nManagement of uncomplicated GERD consists of elevating the head of the bed about 15 cm (6 in) and\\navoiding the following: eating within 2 to 3 h of bedtime, strong stimulants of acid secretion (eg, coffee,\\nalcohol), certain drugs (eg, anticholinergics), specific foods (eg, fats, chocolate), and smoking.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition\\nChapter 12.

Infants and children may be given these drugs at an appropriate lower single\\ndaily dose (ie, omeprazole 20 mg in children > 3 yr, 10 mg in children < 3 yr; lansoprazole 15 mg in\\nchildren ≤ 30 kg, 30 mg in children > 30 kg). These drugs may be continued long-term, but the dose\\nshould be adjusted to the minimum required to prevent symptoms. H2 blockers (eg, ranitidine 150 mg at\\nbedtime) or promotility agents (eg, metoclopramide 10 mg po 30 min before meals and at bedtime) are\\nless effective.\\nAntireflux surgery (usually via laparoscopy) is done on patients with serious esophagitis, large hiatal\\nhernias, hemorrhage, stricture, or ulcers. Esophageal strictures are managed by repeated balloon\\ndilation.\\nBarrett's esophagus may or may not regress with medical or surgical therapy. Because Barrett's\\nesophagus is a precursor to adenocarcinoma, endoscopic surveillance for malignant transformation is\\nrecommended every 1 to 2 yr. Surveillance has uncertain cost-effectiveness in patients with low-grade\\ndysplasia but is important in high-grade dysplasia in patients who are unable to undergo surgical\\nresection. Alternatively, Barrett's esophagus may be treated with endoscopic mucosal resection,\\nphotodynamic therapy, cryotherapy, or laser ablation.\\nHiatus Hernia\\nHiatus hernia is a protrusion of the stomach through the diaphragmatic hiatus. Most hernias are\\nasymptomatic, but an increased incidence of acid reflux may lead to symptoms of\\ngastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Diagnosis is by barium swallow. Treatment is directed\\nat symptoms of GERD if present.\\nEtiology\\nEtiology is usually unknown, but a hiatus hernia is thought to be acquired through stretching of the fascial\", 'attachments between the esophagus and diaphragm at the hiatus (the opening through which the\\nesophagus traverses the diaphragm).\\nPathophysiology\\nIn a sliding hiatus hernia (the most common type), the gastroesophageal junction and a portion of the\\nstomach are above the diaphragm. In a paraesophageal hiatus hernia, the gastroesophageal junction is in\\nthe normal location, but a portion of the stomach is adjacent to the esophagus in the diaphragmatic\\nhiatus. Hernias may also occur through other parts of the diaphragm (see p. 2977).\\nA sliding hiatus hernia is common and is an incidental finding on x-ray in > 40% of the population;\\ntherefore, the relationship of hernia to symptoms is unclear. Although most patients with GERD have\\nsome degree of hiatus hernia, < 50% of patients with hiatus hernia have GERD.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nMost patients with a sliding hiatus hernia are asymptomatic, but chest pain and other reflux symptoms can\\noccur. A paraesophageal hiatus hernia is generally asymptomatic but, unlike a sliding hiatus hernia, may\\nincarcerate and strangulate. Occult or massive GI hemorrhage may occur with either type.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Barium swallow\\nA large hiatus hernia is often discovered incidentally on chest x-ray.

Primary agents\\ninclude Candida albicans, herpes simplex virus, and cytomegalovirus. Symptoms are\\nodynophagia and chest pain. Diagnosis is by endoscopic visualization and culture. Treatment is\\nwith antifungal or antiviral drugs.\\nEsophageal infection is rare in patients with normal host defenses. Primary esophageal defenses include\\nsaliva, esophageal motility, and cellular immunity. Thus, at-risk patients include those with AIDS, organ\\ntransplants, alcoholism, diabetes, undernutrition, cancer, and motility disorders. Candida infection may\\noccur in any of these patients. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections occur\\nmainly in AIDS and transplant patients.\\nCandida: Patients with Candida esophagitis usually complain of odynophagia and, less commonly,\\ndysphagia. About two thirds of patients have signs of oral thrush (thus its absence does not exclude\\nesophageal involvement). Patients with odynophagia and typical thrush may be given empiric treatment,\\nbut if significant improvement does not occur in 5 to 7 days, endoscopic evaluation is required. Barium\\nswallow is less accurate.\\nTreatment is with fluconazole 200 mg po or IV for one dose, then 100 mg po or IV q 24 h for 14 to 21\\ndays. Alternatives include the azoles (eg, itraconazole, voriconazole, ketoconazole) or echinocandins (eg,\\ncaspofungin). Topical therapy has no role.\\nHSV and CMV: These infections are equally likely in transplant patients, but HSV occurs early after\\ntransplantation (reactivation) and CMV occurs 2 to 6 mo after. Among AIDS patients, CMV is much more', \"common than HSV, and viral esophagitis occurs mainly when the CD4+ count is < 200/μL. Severe\\nodynophagia results from either infection.\\nEndoscopy, with cytology or biopsy, is usually necessary for diagnosis. HSV is treated with IV acyclovir 5\\nmg/kg q 8 h for 7 days or valacyclovir 1 g po tid. CMV is treated with ganciclovir 5 mg/kg IV q 12 h for 14\\nto 21 days with maintenance at 5 mg/kg IV 5 days/wk in immunocompromised patients. Alternatives\\ninclude foscarnet and cidofovir.\\nMallory-Weiss Syndrome\\nMallory-Weiss syndrome is a nonpenetrating mucosal laceration of the distal esophagus and\\nproximal stomach caused by vomiting, retching, or hiccuping.\\nInitially described in alcoholics, Mallory-Weiss syndrome can occur in any patient who vomits forcefully. It\\nis the cause of about 5% of episodes of upper GI hemorrhage. Most episodes of bleeding stop\\nspontaneously; severe bleeding occurs in about 10% of patients who require significant intervention,\\nsuch as transfusion or endoscopic hemostasis (by injection of ethanol, polidocanol, or epinephrine or by\\nelectrocautery). Intra-arterial infusion of pitressin or therapeutic embolization into the left gastric artery\\nduring angiography may also be used to control bleeding. Surgical repair is rarely required.\\nEsophageal Rupture\\nEsophageal rupture may be iatrogenic during endoscopic procedures or other instrumentation\\nor may be spontaneous (Boerhaave's syndrome).

Gastritis and Peptic Ulcer Disease\\nIntroduction\\nAcid is secreted by parietal cells in the proximal two thirds (body) of the stomach. Gastric acid aids\\ndigestion by creating the optimal pH for pepsin and gastric lipase and by stimulating pancreatic\\nbicarbonate secretion. Acid secretion is initiated by food: the thought, smell, or taste of food effects vagal\\nstimulation of the gastrin-secreting G cells located in the distal one third (antrum) of the stomach. The\\narrival of protein to the stomach further stimulates gastrin output. Circulating gastrin triggers the release\\nof histamine from enterochromaffin-like cells in the body of the stomach. Histamine stimulates the parietal\\ncells via their H2 receptors. The parietal cells secrete acid, and the resulting drop in pH causes the antral\\nD cells to release somatostatin, which inhibits gastrin release (negative feedback control).\\nAcid secretion is present at birth and reaches adult levels (on a weight basis) by age 2. There is a decline\\nin acid output in elderly patients who develop chronic gastritis, but acid output is otherwise maintained\\nthroughout life.\\nNormally, the GI mucosa is protected by several distinct mechanisms: (1) Mucosal production of mucus\\nand HCO3 creates a pH gradient from the gastric lumen (low pH) to the mucosa (neutral pH). The mucus\\nserves as a barrier to the diffusion of acid and pepsin. (2) Epithelial cells remove excess hydrogen ions\\n(H+) via membrane transport systems and have tight junctions, which prevent back diffusion of H+ ions.\\n(3) Mucosal blood flow removes excess acid that has diffused across the epithelial layer. Several growth\\nfactors (eg, epidermal growth factor, insulin-like growth factor I) and prostaglandins have been linked to\\nmucosal repair and maintenance of mucosal integrity.\\nFactors that interfere with these mucosal defenses (particularly NSAIDs and Helicobacter pylori\\ninfection) predispose to gastritis and peptic ulcer disease.\\nNSAIDs promote mucosal inflammation and ulcer formation (sometimes with GI bleeding) both topically', 'NSAIDs promote mucosal inflammation and ulcer formation (sometimes with GI bleeding) both topically\\nand systemically. By inhibiting prostaglandin production via blockage of the enzyme cyclooxygenase\\n(COX), NSAIDs reduce gastric blood flow, reduce mucus and HCO3 secretion, and decrease cell repair\\nand replication. Also, because NSAIDs are weak acids and are nonionized at gastric pH, they diffuse\\nfreely across the mucus barrier into gastric epithelial cells, where H+ ions are liberated, leading to cellular\\ndamage. Because gastric prostaglandin production involves the COX-1 isoform, NSAIDs that are selective\\nCOX-2 inhibitors have fewer adverse gastric effects than other NSAIDs.\\nHelicobacter pylori Infection\\nH. pylori is a common gastric pathogen that causes gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, gastric\\nadenocarcinoma, and low-grade gastric lymphoma. Infection may be asymptomatic or result in\\nvarying degrees of dyspepsia. Diagnosis is by urea breath test and testing of endoscopic\\nbiopsy samples. Treatment is with a proton pump inhibitor plus two antibiotics.\\nH. pylori is a spiral-shaped, gram-negative organism that has adapted to thrive in acid. In developing\\ncountries, it commonly causes chronic infections and is usually acquired during childhood. In the US,\\ninfection is less common among children but increases with age: by age 60, about 50% of people are\\ninfected. Infection is most common among blacks, Hispanics, and Asians.\\nThe organism has been cultured from stool, saliva, and dental plaque, which suggests oral-oral or fecal-\\noral transmission. Infections tend to cluster in families and in residents of custodial institutions. Nurses\\nand gastroenterologists seem to be at high risk because bacteria can be transmitted by improperly\\ndisinfected endoscopes.\\nPathophysiology\\nEffects of H. pylori infection vary depending on the location within the stomach.

Tests are done during evaluation for peptic ulcer\\nand gastritis. Posttreatment testing is typically done to confirm eradication of the organism. Different tests\\nare preferred for initial diagnosis and posttreatment.\\nNoninvasive tests: Laboratory and office-based serologic assays for antibodies to H. pylori have\\nsensitivity and specificity of > 85% and are considered the noninvasive tests of choice for initial\\ndocumentation of H. pylori infection.

Aluminum hydroxide causes constipation.\\nMg hydroxide is a more effective antacid than aluminum but may cause diarrhea. To limit diarrhea, many\\nproprietary antacids combine Mg and aluminum antacids. Because small amounts of Mg are absorbed,\\nMg preparations should be used with caution in patients with renal disease.\\nProstaglandins: Certain prostaglandins (especially misoprostol) inhibit acid secretion by decreasing the\\ngeneration of cyclic AMP that is triggered by histamine stimulation of the parietal cell, and enhance\\nmucosal defense. Synthetic prostaglandin derivatives are used predominantly to decrease the risk of\\nNSAID-induced mucosal injury.

Pancreatitis\\nIntroduction\\nPancreatitis is classified as either acute or chronic. Acute pancreatitis is inflammation that resolves both\\nclinically and histologically. Chronic pancreatitis is characterized by histologic changes that are\\nirreversible and progressive and that result in considerable loss of exocrine and endocrine pancreatic\\nfunction. Patients with chronic pancreatitis may have a flare-up of acute disease.\\nPancreatitis can affect both the exocrine and endocrine functions of the pancreas. Pancreatic acinar cells\\nsecrete bicarbonate and digestive enzymes into ducts that connect the pancreas to the duodenum at the\\nampulla of Vater (exocrine function). Pancreatic β-cells secrete insulin directly into the bloodstream\\n(endocrine function).\\nAcute Pancreatitis\\nAcute pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas (and, sometimes, adjacent tissues) caused\\nby the release of activated pancreatic enzymes. The most common triggers are biliary tract\\ndisease and chronic heavy alcohol intake. The condition ranges from mild (abdominal pain and\\nvomiting) to severe (pancreatic necrosis and a systemic inflammatory process with shock and\\nmultiorgan failure). Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation and serum amylase and lipase\\nlevels. Treatment is supportive, with IV fluids, analgesics, and fasting.\\nEtiology\\nBiliary tract disease and alcoholism account for ≥ 80% of acute pancreatitis cases. The remaining 20%\\nresult from myriad causes (see\\nTable 15-1).\\nPathophysiology\\nThe precise mechanism by which obstruction of the sphincter of Oddi by a gallstone or microlithiasis\\n(sludge) causes pancreatitis is unclear, although it probably involves increased ductal pressure.\\nProlonged alcohol intake (> 100 g/day for > 3 to 5 yr) may cause the protein of pancreatic enzymes to\\nprecipitate within small pancreatic ductules. Ductal obstruction by these protein plugs may cause\\npremature activation of pancreatic enzymes. An alcohol binge in such patients can trigger pancreatitis, but\\nthe exact mechanism is not known.\\nA number of genetic mutations predisposing to pancreatitis have been identified. One, an autosomal', 'dominant mutation of the cationic trypsinogen gene, causes pancreatitis in 80% of carriers; an obvious\\nfamilial pattern is present. Other mutations have lesser penetrance and are not readily apparent clinically\\nexcept through genetic testing. The genetic abnormality responsible for cystic fibrosis increases the risk\\nof recurrent acute as well as chronic pancreatitis.\\nRegardless of the etiology, pancreatic enzymes (including trypsin, phospholipase A2, and elastase)\\nbecome activated within the gland itself. The enzymes can damage tissue and activate complement and\\nthe inflammatory cascade, producing cytokines. This process causes inflammation, edema, and\\nsometimes necrosis. In mild pancreatitis, inflammation is confined to the pancreas; the mortality rate is <\\n5%. In severe pancreatitis, there is significant inflammation, with necrosis and hemorrhage of the gland\\nand a systemic inflammatory response; the mortality rate is 10 to 50%. After 5 to 7 days, necrotic\\npancreatic tissue may become infected by enteric bacteria.\\n[Table 15-1. Some Causes of Acute Pancreatitis]\\nActivated enzymes and cytokines that enter the peritoneal cavity cause a chemical burn and third spacing\\nof fluid; those that enter the systemic circulation cause a systemic inflammatory response that can result\\nin acute respiratory distress syndrome and renal failure.

Phospholipase A2 is thought to injure alveolar membranes of the lungs.\\nIn about 40% of patients, collections of enzyme-rich pancreatic fluid and tissue debris form in and around\\nthe pancreas. In about half, the collections resolve spontaneously. In others, the collections become\\ninfected or form pseudocysts. Pseudocysts have a fibrous capsule without an epithelial lining.\\nPseudocysts may hemorrhage, rupture, or become infected.\\nDeath during the first several days is usually caused by cardiovascular instability (with refractory shock\\nand renal failure) or respiratory failure (with hypoxemia and at times adult respiratory distress syndrome).\\nOccasionally, death results from heart failure secondary to an unidentified myocardial depressant factor.\\nDeath after the first week is usually caused by multiorgan system failure.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nAn acute attack causes steady, boring upper abdominal pain, typically severe enough to require large\\ndoses of parenteral opioids. The pain radiates through to the back in about 50% of patients; rarely, pain\\nis first felt in the lower abdomen. Pain usually develops suddenly in gallstone pancreatitis; in alcoholic\\npancreatitis, pain develops over a few days. The pain usually persists for several days. Sitting up and\\nleaning forward may reduce pain, but coughing, vigorous movement, and deep breathing may accentuate\\nit. Nausea and vomiting are common.\\nThe patient appears acutely ill and sweaty. Pulse rate is usually 100 to 140 beats/min. Respiration is\\nshallow and rapid. BP may be transiently high or low, with significant postural hypotension. Temperature\\nmay be normal or even subnormal at first but may increase to 37.7 to 38.3° C (100 to 101° F) within a few\\nhours. Sensorium may be blunted to the point of semicoma. Scleral icterus is occasionally present. The\\nlungs may have limited diaphragmatic excursion and evidence of atelectasis.\\nAbout 20% of patients experience upper abdominal distention caused by gastric distention or\\ndisplacement of the stomach by a pancreatic inflammatory mass. Pancreatic duct disruption may cause', \"displacement of the stomach by a pancreatic inflammatory mass. Pancreatic duct disruption may cause\\nascites (pancreatic ascites). Marked abdominal tenderness occurs, most often in the upper abdomen.\\nThere may be mild tenderness in the lower abdomen, but the rectum is not tender and the stool is usually\\nnegative for occult blood. Mild-to-moderate muscular rigidity may be present in the upper abdomen but is\\nrare in the lower abdomen. Rarely, severe peritoneal irritation results in a rigid and boardlike abdomen.\\nBowel sounds may be hypoactive. Grey Turner's sign (ecchymoses of the flanks) and Cullen's sign\\n(ecchymoses of the umbilical region) indicate extravasation of hemorrhagic exudate.\\nInfection in the pancreas or in an adjacent fluid collection should be suspected if the patient has a\\ngenerally toxic appearance with elevated temperature and WBC count or if deterioration follows an initial\\nperiod of stabilization.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Serum markers (amylase, lipase)\\n• Once pancreatitis is diagnosed, CT usually done\\nPancreatitis is suspected whenever severe abdominal pain occurs, especially in a patient with significant\\nalcohol use or known gallstones. Conditions causing similar symptoms include perforated gastric or\\nduodenal ulcer, mesenteric infarction, strangulating intestinal obstruction, dissecting aneurysm, biliary\\ncolic, appendicitis, diverticulitis, inferior wall MI, and hematoma of the abdominal muscles or spleen.\\nDiagnosis is made by clinical suspicion, serum markers (amylase and lipase), and the absence of other\\ncauses for the patient's symptoms. Thus, a broad range of tests is done, typically including CBC,\\nelectrolytes, Ca, Mg, glucose, BUN, creatinine, amylase, and lipase. Other routine tests include ECG and\\nan abdominal series (chest, flat, and upright abdomen). A urine dipstick for trypsinogen-2 has sensitivity\\nand specificity of > 90% for acute pancreatitis.

Lipase is more specific for pancreatitis, but both enzymes\\nmay be increased in renal failure and various abdominal conditions (eg, perforated ulcer, mesenteric\\nvascular occlusion, intestinal obstruction). Other causes of increased serum amylase include salivary\\ngland dysfunction, macroamylasemia, and tumors that secrete amylase. Both amylase and lipase levels\\nmay remain normal if destruction of acinar tissue during previous episodes precludes release of sufficient\\namounts of enzymes. The serum of patients with hypertriglyceridemia may contain a circulating inhibitor\\nthat must be diluted before an elevation in serum amylase can be detected.\\nAmylase:creatinine clearance ratio does not have sufficient sensitivity or specificity to diagnose\\npancreatitis. It is generally used to diagnose macroamylasemia when no pancreatitis exists. In\\nmacroamylasemia, amylase bound to serum immunoglobulin falsely elevates the serum amylase level.\\nFractionation of total serum amylase into pancreatic type (p-type) isoamylase and salivary-type (s-type)\\nisoamylase increases the accuracy of serum amylase. However, the level of p-type also increases in\\nrenal failure and in other severe abdominal conditions in which amylase clearance is altered.\\nThe WBC count usually increases to 12,000 to 20,000/μL. Third-space fluid losses may increase the Hct\\nto as high as 50 to 55%, indicating severe inflammation. Hyperglycemia may occur. Serum Ca\\nconcentration falls as early as the first day because of the formation of Ca \"soaps\" secondary to excess\\ngeneration of free fatty acids, especially by pancreatic lipase. Serum bilirubin increases in 15 to 25% of\\npatients because pancreatic edema compresses the common bile duct.\\nImaging: Plain x-rays of the abdomen may disclose calcifications within pancreatic ducts (evidence of\\nprior inflammation and hence chronic pancreatitis), calcified gallstones, or localized ileus in the left upper', 'quadrant or the center of the abdomen (a \"sentinel loop\" of small bowel, dilation of the transverse colon,\\nor duodenal ileus). Chest x-ray may reveal atelectasis or a pleural effusion (usually left-sided or bilateral\\nbut rarely confined to the right pleural space).\\nUltrasound should be done if gallstone pancreatitis is suspected (and another etiology is not obvious) to\\ndetect gallstones or dilation of the common bile duct (which indicates biliary tract obstruction). Edema of\\nthe pancreas may be visualized, but overlying gas frequently obscures the pancreas.\\nCT with IV contrast is generally done to identify necrosis, fluid collections, or pseudocysts once\\npancreatitis has been diagnosed. It is particularly recommended for severe pancreatitis or if a\\ncomplication ensues (eg, hypotension or progressive leukocytosis and elevation of temperature). IV\\ncontrast facilitates the recognition of pancreatic necrosis; however, it may cause pancreatic necrosis in\\nareas of low perfusion (ie, ischemia). Thus, contrast-enhanced CT should be done only after the patient\\nhas been adequately hydrated.\\nIf pancreatic infection is suspected, fluid obtained by percutaneous CT-guided needle aspiration of cysts\\nor areas of fluid collection or necrosis may reveal organisms on Gram stain or culture. The diagnosis is\\nsupported by positive blood cultures and, particularly, by the presence of air bubbles in the\\nretroperitoneum on abdominal CT. The advent of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography\\n(MRCP) may make the selection of pancreatic imaging simpler.\\nPrognosis\\nIn edematous pancreatitis, mortality is < 5%. In pancreatitis with necrosis and hemorrhage, mortality is 10\\nto 50%. In pancreatic infection, mortality is usually 100% without extensive surgical debridement or\\ndrainage of the infected area.\\nCT findings correlate with prognosis. If CT is normal or shows only mild pancreatic edema (Balthazar\\nclass A or B), the prognosis is excellent.

If the main pancreatic duct is dilated', '> 5 to 8 mm, a lateral pancreaticojejunostomy (Puestow procedure) relieves pain in about 70 to 80% of\\npatients. If the duct is not dilated, a partial resection is similarly effective; either distal pancreatectomy (for\\nextensive disease at the tail of the pancreas) or Whipple procedure (for extensive disease at the head of\\nthe pancreas) is done. Operative approaches should be reserved for patients who have stopped using\\nalcohol and who can manage diabetes that may be intensified by pancreatic resection.\\nSome pseudocysts can be drained endoscopically. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided denervation of the\\nceliac plexus with alcohol and bupivacaine may provide pain relief. If there is significant stricture at the\\npapilla or distal pancreatic duct, ERCP with sphincterotomy, stent placement, or dilatation may be\\neffective.\\nOral hypoglycemic drugs rarely help treat diabetes caused by chronic pancreatitis. Insulin should be given\\ncautiously because the coexisting deficiency of glucagon secretion by α-cells means that the\\nhypoglycemic effects of insulin are unopposed and prolonged hypoglycemia may occur.\\nPatients are at increased risk of pancreatic cancer. Worsening of symptoms, especially with development\\nof a pancreatic duct stricture, should prompt an evaluation for cancer. Evaluation may include brushing\\nstrictures for cytologic analysis or measuring serum markers (eg, CA 19-9, carcinoembryonic antigen).\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition\\nChapter 15.

Gastroenteritis\\nIntroduction\\n(See also Food Allergy on p. 1118 and Mushroom Poisoning on p. 3336.)\\nGastroenteritis is inflammation of the lining of the stomach and small and large intestines. Most\\ncases are infectious, although gastroenteritis may occur after ingestion of drugs and chemical\\ntoxins (eg, metals, plant substances). Symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,\\nand abdominal discomfort. Diagnosis is clinical or by stool culture, although immunoassays are\\nincreasingly used. Treatment is symptomatic, although parasitic and some bacterial infections\\nrequire specific anti-infective therapy.\\nGastroenteritis is usually uncomfortable but self-limited. Electrolyte and fluid loss is usually little more than\\nan inconvenience to an otherwise healthy adult but can be grave for people who are very young (see p.\\n2806), elderly, or debilitated or who have serious concomitant illnesses. Worldwide, an estimated 3 to 6\\nmillion children die each year from infectious gastroenteritis.\\nEtiology\\nInfectious gastroenteritis may be caused by viruses, bacteria, or parasites. Many specific organisms are\\ndiscussed further in the Infectious Diseases section.\\nViruses: The viruses most commonly implicated are\\n• Rotavirus\\n• Norovirus\\nViruses are the most common cause of gastroenteritis in the US. They infect enterocytes in the villous\\nepithelium of the small bowel. The result is transudation of fluid and salts into the intestinal lumen;\\nsometimes, malabsorption of carbohydrates worsens symptoms by causing osmotic diarrhea. Diarrhea is\\nwatery. Inflammatory diarrhea (dysentery), with fecal WBCs and RBCs or gross blood, is uncommon. Four\\ncategories of viruses cause most gastroenteritis: rotavirus and calicivirus (predominantly the norovirus\\n[formerly Norwalk virus]) cause the majority of viral gastroenteritis, followed by astrovirus and enteric\\nadenovirus.\\nRotavirus is the most common cause of sporadic, severe, dehydrating diarrhea in young children (peak\\nincidence, 3 to 15 mo). Rotavirus is highly contagious; most infections occur by the fecal-oral route. Adults', 'may be infected after close contact with an infected infant. The illness in adults is generally mild.\\nIncubation is 1 to 3 days. In temperate climates, most infections occur in the winter. Each year in the US,\\na wave of rotavirus illness begins in the Southwest in November and ends in the Northeast in March.\\nNorovirus most commonly infects older children and adults. Infections occur year-round. Norovirus is the\\nprincipal cause of sporadic viral gastroenteritis in adults and of epidemic viral gastroenteritis in all age\\ngroups; large waterborne and food-borne outbreaks occur. Person-to-person transmission also occurs\\nbecause the virus is highly contagious. Incubation is 24 to 48 h.\\nAstrovirus can infect people of all ages but usually infects infants and young children. Infection is most\\ncommon in winter. Transmission is by the fecal-oral route. Incubation is 3 to 4 days.\\nAdenoviruses are the 4th most common cause of childhood viral gastroenteritis. Infections occur year-\\nround, with a slight increase in summer. Children < 2 yr are primarily affected. Transmission is by the\\nfecal-oral route. Incubation is 3 to 10 days.\\nIn immunocompromised patients, additional viruses (eg, cytomegalovirus, enterovirus) can cause\\ngastroenteritis.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition\\nChapter 16.

Bacteria cause gastroenteritis by several mechanisms.\\nCertain species (eg, Vibrio cholerae, enterotoxigenic strains of E. coli) adhere to intestinal mucosa\\nwithout invading and produce enterotoxins. These toxins impair intestinal absorption and cause secretion\\nof electrolytes and water by stimulating adenylate cyclase, resulting in watery diarrhea. Clostridium\\ndifficile produces a similar toxin when overgrowth follows antibiotic use (see p. 1292).\\nSome bacteria (eg, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens) produce an\\nexotoxin that is ingested in contaminated food. The exotoxin can cause gastroenteritis without bacterial\\ninfection. These toxins generally cause acute nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea within 12 h of ingestion of\\ncontaminated food. Symptoms abate within 36 h.\\nOther bacteria (eg, Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter, some E. coli subtypes) invade the mucosa of\\nthe small bowel or colon and cause microscopic ulceration, bleeding, exudation of protein-rich fluid, and\\nsecretion of electrolytes and water. The invasive process and its results can occur whether or not the\\norganism produces an enterotoxin. The resulting diarrhea contains WBCs and RBCs and sometimes\\ngross blood.\\nSalmonella and Campylobacter are the most common bacterial causes of diarrheal illness in the US.\\nBoth infections are most frequently acquired through undercooked poultry; unpasteurized milk is also a\\npossible source. Campylobacter is occasionally transmitted from dogs or cats with diarrhea. Salmonella\\ncan be transmitted by undercooked eggs and by contact with reptiles. Species of Shigella are the 3rd\\nmost common bacterial cause of diarrhea in the US and are usually transmitted person to person,\\nalthough food-borne epidemics occur. Shigella dysenteriae type 1 (not present in the US) produces', \"Shiga toxin, which can cause hemolytic-uremic syndrome (see p. 961).\\nSeveral different subtypes of E. coli cause diarrhea. The epidemiology and clinical manifestations vary\\ngreatly depending on the subtype: (1) Enterohemorrhagic E. coli is the most clinically significant subtype\\nin the US. It produces Shiga toxin, which causes bloody diarrhea (hemorrhagic colitis). E. coli O157:H7 is\\nthe most common strain of this subtype in the US. Undercooked ground beef, unpasteurized milk and\\njuice, and contaminated water are possible sources. Person-to-person transmission is common in the day\\ncare setting. Hemolytic-uremic syndrome is a serious complication that develops in 2 to 7% of cases,\\nmost commonly among the young and old. (2) Enterotoxigenic E. coli produces two toxins (one similar to\\ncholera toxin) that cause watery diarrhea. This subtype is the most common cause of traveler's diarrhea.\\n(3) Enteropathogenic E. coli causes watery diarrhea. Once a common cause of diarrhea outbreaks in\\nnurseries, this subtype is now rare. (4) Enteroinvasive E. coli causes bloody or nonbloody diarrhea,\\nprimarily in the developing world. It is rare in the US.\\nSeveral other bacteria cause gastroenteritis, but most are uncommon in the US. Yersinia enterocolitica\\ncan cause gastroenteritis or a syndrome that mimics appendicitis. It is transmitted by undercooked pork,\\nunpasteurized milk, or contaminated water. Several Vibrio species (eg, V. parahaemolyticus) cause\\ndiarrhea after ingestion of undercooked seafood. V. cholerae sometimes causes severe dehydrating\\ndiarrhea in the developing world. Listeria causes food-borne gastroenteritis. Aeromonas is acquired from\\nswimming in or drinking contaminated fresh or brackish water.

It is usually acquired via person-to-person transmission (often in day care centers) or from\\ncontaminated water.\\nCryptosporidium parvum causes watery diarrhea sometimes accompanied by abdominal cramps, nausea,\\nand vomiting. In healthy people, the illness is self-limited, lasting about 2 wk. In immunocompromised\\npatients, illness may be severe, causing substantial electrolyte and fluid loss. Cryptosporidium is usually\\nacquired through contaminated water.\\nOther parasites that can cause symptoms similar to those of cryptosporidiosis include Cyclospora\\ncayetanensis and, in immunocompromised patients, Cystoisospora (Isospora) belli, and a collection of\\norganisms referred to as microsporidia (eg, Enterocytozoon bieneusi, Encephalitozoon intestinalis).\\nEntamoeba histolytica (amebiasis) is a common cause of subacute bloody diarrhea in the developing\\nworld and occasionally occurs in the US.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nThe character and severity of symptoms vary. Generally, onset is sudden, with anorexia, nausea,\\nvomiting, borborygmi, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea (with or without blood and mucus). Malaise,\\nmyalgias, and prostration may occur.

Findings suggestive of gastroenteritis include copious, watery diarrhea; ingestion of potentially\\ncontaminated food (particularly during a known outbreak), untreated surface water, or a known GI irritant;\\nrecent travel; or contact with similarly ill people. E. coli O157:H7-induced diarrhea is notorious for\\nappearing to be a hemorrhagic rather than an infectious process, manifesting as GI bleeding with little or\\nno stool. Hemolyticuremic syndrome may follow as evidenced by renal failure and hemolytic anemia (see\\np. 961). Recent oral antibiotic use (within 3 mo) must raise suspicion for C. difficile infection (see p.\\n1292).\\nStool testing: If a rectal examination shows occult blood or if watery diarrhea persists > 48 h, stool\\nexamination (fecal WBCs, ova, parasites) and culture are indicated. However, for the diagnosis of\\ngiardiasis or cryptosporidiosis, stool antigen detection using an enzyme immunoassay has a higher\\nsensitivity. Rotavirus and enteric adenovirus infections can be diagnosed using commercially available\\nrapid assays that detect viral antigen in the stool, but these are usually done only to document an\\noutbreak.\\nAll patients with grossly bloody diarrhea should be tested for E. coli O157:H7, as should patients with\\nnonbloody diarrhea during a known outbreak. Specific cultures must be requested because this organism\\nis not detected on standard stool culture media. Alternatively, a rapid enzyme assay for the detection of\\nShiga toxin in stool can be done; a positive test indicates infection with E. coli O157:H7 or one of the\\nother serotypes of enterohemorrhagic E. coli.

Malabsorption Syndromes\\nIntroduction\\nMalabsorption is inadequate assimilation of dietary substances due to defects in digestion, absorption, or\\ntransport. Malabsorption can affect macronutrients (eg, proteins, carbohydrates, fats), micronutrients (eg,\\nvitamins, minerals), or both, causing excessive fecal excretion, nutritional deficiencies, and GI symptoms.\\nPathophysiology\\nDigestion and absorption occur in three phases: (1) intraluminal hydrolysis of fats, proteins, and\\ncarbohydrates by enzymes—bile salts enhance the solubilization of fat in this phase; (2) digestion by\\nbrush border enzymes and uptake of end-products; and (3) lymphatic transport of nutrients.\\nMalabsorption occurs when any of these phases is impaired.\\nFats: Pancreatic enzymes split long-chain triglycerides into fatty acids and monoglycerides, which\\ncombine with bile acids and phospholipids to form micelles that pass through jejunal enterocytes.\\nAbsorbed fatty acids are resynthesized and combined with protein, cholesterol, and phospholipid to form\\nchylomicrons, which are transported by the lymphatic system. Medium-chain triglycerides are absorbed\\ndirectly.\\nUnabsorbed fats trap fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) and possibly some minerals, causing deficiency.\\nBacterial overgrowth results in deconjugation and dehydroxylation of bile salts, limiting the absorption of\\nfats. Unabsorbed bile salts stimulate the colon, causing diarrhea.\\nCarbohydrates: Enzymes on microvilli lyse carbohydrates and disaccharides into constituent\\nmonosaccharides. Colonic bacteria ferment unabsorbed carbohydrates into CO2, methane, H2, and\\nshort-chain fatty acids (butyrate, propionate, acetate, and lactate). These fatty acids cause diarrhea. The\\ngases cause abdominal distention and bloating.\\nProteins: Enterokinase, a brush border enzyme, activates trypsinogen into trypsin, which converts many', 'pancreatic proteases into their active forms. Active pancreatic enzymes hydrolyze proteins into\\noligopeptides, which are absorbed directly or hydrolyzed into amino acids.\\nEtiology\\nMalabsorption has many causes (see\\nTable 17-1). Some malabsorptive disorders (eg, celiac sprue) impair the absorption of most nutrients,\\nvitamins, and trace minerals (global malabsorption); others (eg, pernicious anemia) are more selective.\\n[Table 17-1. Causes of Malabsorption]\\nPancreatic insufficiency causes malabsorption if > 90% of function is lost. Increased luminal acidity (eg,\\nZollinger-Ellison syndrome) inhibits lipase and fat digestion. Cirrhosis and cholestasis reduce hepatic bile\\nsynthesis or delivery of bile salts to the duodenum, causing malabsorption. Other causes are discussed\\nelsewhere in this chapter.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nThe effects of unabsorbed substances include diarrhea, steatorrhea, abdominal bloating, and gas. Other\\nsymptoms result from nutritional deficiencies.

The etiology is\\nsometimes obvious. For example, those with malabsorption due to chronic pancreatitis usually have had\\nprior bouts of acute pancreatitis. Patients with celiac sprue can present with classic lifelong diarrhea\\nexacerbated by gluten products and may have dermatitis herpetiformis. Those with cirrhosis and\\npancreatic cancer can present with jaundice. Abdominal distention, excessive flatus, and watery diarrhea\\noccurring 30 to 90 min after carbohydrate ingestion suggest deficiency of a disaccharidase enzyme,\\nusually lactase. Previous extensive abdominal operations suggest short bowel syndrome.\\nIf the history suggests a specific cause, testing should be directed to that condition (see\\nFig. 17-1). If no cause is readily apparent, blood tests can be used as screening tools (eg, CBC, RBC\\nindices, ferritin, vitamin B12, folate, Ca, albumin, cholesterol, PT). These results may suggest a diagnosis\\nand direct further investigation.\\n[Table 17-2. Symptoms of Malabsorption]\\nMacrocytic anemia should prompt measurement of serum folate and B12 levels. Folate deficiency is\\ncommon in mucosal disorders involving the proximal small bowel (eg, celiac sprue, tropical sprue,\\nWhipple's disease). Low B12 levels can occur in pernicious anemia, chronic pancreatitis, bacterial\\novergrowth, and terminal ileal disease. A combination of low B12 and high folate levels is suggestive of\", 'bacterial overgrowth, because intestinal bacteria use vitamin B12 and synthesize folate.\\nMicrocytic anemia suggests iron deficiency, which may occur with celiac sprue. Albumin is a general\\nindicator of nutritional state. Low albumin can result from poor intake, decreased synthesis in cirrhosis, or\\nprotein wasting.

Irritable Bowel Syndrome\\n(Spastic Colon)\\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is characterized by abdominal discomfort or pain that is\\naccompanied by at least two of the following: relief by defecation, change in frequency of stool,\\nor change in consistency of stool. The cause is unknown, and the pathophysiology is\\nincompletely understood. Diagnosis is clinical. Treatment is symptomatic, consisting of dietary\\nmanagement and drugs, including anticholinergics and agents active at serotonin receptors.\\nEtiology\\nThe cause of IBS is unknown. No anatomic cause can be found on laboratory tests, x-rays, and biopsies.\\nEmotional factors, diet, drugs, or hormones may precipitate or aggravate GI symptoms. Historically, the\\ndisorder was often considered as purely psychosomatic. Although psychosocial factors are involved, IBS\\nis better understood as a combination of psychosocial and physiologic factors.\\nPsychosocial factors: Psychologic distress is common among patients with IBS, especially among\\nthose who seek medical care. Some patients have anxiety disorders, depression, or a somatization\\ndisorder. Sleep disturbances also coexist. However, stress and emotional conflict do not always coincide\\nwith symptom onset and recurrence. Some patients with IBS seem to have a learned aberrant illness\\nbehavior (ie, they express emotional conflict as a GI complaint, usually abdominal pain). The physician\\nevaluating patients with IBS, particularly those with refractory symptoms, should investigate for\\nunresolved psychologic issues, including the possibility of sexual or physical abuse. Psychosocial factors\\nalso affect the outcome in IBS.\\nPhysiologic factors: A variety of physiologic factors seem to be involved in IBS symptoms. Factors\\ninclude altered motility, visceral hyperalgesia, and various genetic and environmental factors.\\nVisceral hyperalgesia refers to hypersensitivity to normal amounts of intraluminal distention and\\nheightened perception of pain in the presence of normal quantities of intestinal gas; it may result from\\nremodeling of neural pathways in the brain-gut axis. Some patients (perhaps 1 in 7) have reported their\\nIBS symptoms began after an episode of acute gastroenteritis (termed postinfectious IBS). A subset of', 'patients with IBS has autonomic dysfunctions. However, many patients have no demonstrable physiologic\\nabnormalities, and even in those that do, the abnormalities may not correlate with symptoms.\\nConstipation may be explained by slower colonic transit, and diarrhea may be explained by faster colonic\\ntransit. Some patients with constipation have fewer colonic high amplitude-propagated contractions,\\nwhich propel colonic contents over several segments. Conversely, excess sigmoid motor activity may\\nretard transit in functional constipation.\\nPostprandial abdominal discomfort may be attributed to an exaggerated gastro-colonic reflex (the colonic\\ncontractile response to a meal), the presence of colonic high amplitude-propagated contractions,\\nincreased intestinal sensitivity (visceral hyperalgesia), or a combination of these. Fat ingestion may\\nexaggerate hypersensitivity.\\nHormonal fluctuations affect bowel functions in women. Rectal sensitivity is increased during menses but\\nnot during other phases of the menstrual cycle. The effects of sex steroids on GI transit are subtle. The\\nrole of small-bowel bacterial overgrowth in IBS is controversial.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nIBS tends to begin in the teens and 20s, causing bouts of symptoms that recur at irregular periods. Onset\\nin late adult life is less common but not rare. Symptoms rarely rouse the sleeping patient.

Pain or discomfort related\\nto defecation is likely to be of bowel origin; that associated with exercise, movement, urination, or\\nmenstruation usually has a different cause. Although bowel patterns are relatively consistent in most\\npatients, it is not unusual for patients to alternate between constipation and diarrhea. Patients may also\\nhave symptoms of abnormal stool passage (straining, urgency, or feeling of incomplete evacuation), pass\\nmucus, or complain of bloating or abdominal distention. Many patients also have symptoms of dyspepsia.\\nExtraintestinal symptoms (eg, fatigue, fibromyalgia, sleep disturbances, chronic headaches) are common.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Clinical evaluation, based on Rome criteria\\n• Screening for organic causes with basic laboratory tests and sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy\\n• Other tests for patients with red flag findings (rectal blood, weight loss, fever)\\nDiagnosis is based on characteristic bowel patterns, time and character of pain, and exclusion of other\\ndisease processes through physical examination and routine diagnostic tests. Diagnostic testing should\\nbe more intensive when the following red flag findings are present either at initial presentation or at any\\ntime after diagnosis: older age, fever, weight loss, rectal bleeding, vomiting. Because patients with IBS\\ncan develop organic conditions, testing for other conditions should also be considered in patients who\\ndevelop alarm symptoms or markedly different symptoms during the course of IBS. Common illnesses that\\nmay be confused with IBS include lactose intolerance, drug-induced diarrhea, post-cholecystectomy\\ndiarrhea, laxative abuse, parasitic diseases (eg, giardiasis), eosinophilic gastritis or enteritis, microscopic\\ncolitis, and early inflammatory bowel disease. However, uninflamed colonic diverticula do not cause\\nsymptoms, and their presence should not be considered explanatory.\\nThe bimodal age distribution of patients with inflammatory bowel disease makes it imperative to evaluate\\nboth younger and older patients. In patients > 60 with acute symptoms, ischemic colitis should be', \"considered. Patients with constipation and no anatomic lesion should be evaluated for hypothyroidism\\nand hyperparathyroidism. If the patient's symptoms suggest malabsorption, tropical sprue, celiac disease,\\nand Whipple's disease must be considered. Defecatory disorders should be considered as a cause of\\nconstipation in patients who report symptoms of difficult defecation. Rare causes of diarrhea include\\nhyperthyroidism, medullary cancer of the thyroid, or carcinoid syndrome, gastrinoma, vipoma, and\\nZollinger-Ellison syndrome. However, secretory diarrhea caused by vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP),\\ncalcitonin, or gastrin is typically accompanied by stool volumes > 1000 mL daily.\\nHistory: Particular attention should be given to the character of the pain, bowel habits, familial\\ninterrelationships, and drug and dietary histories. Equally important are the patient's overall emotional\\nstate, interpretation of personal problems and quality of life. The quality of the patient-physician\\ninteraction is key to diagnostic and therapeutic efficacy.\\nThe Rome criteria are standardized symptom-based criteria for diagnosing IBS. The Rome criteria\\nrequire the presence of abdominal pain or discomfort for at least 3 days/mo in the last 3 mo along with ≥ 2\\nof the following: (1) improvement with defecation, (2) onset (of each episode of discomfort) associated\\nwith a change in frequency of defecation, or (3) change in consistency of stool.\\nPhysical examination: Patients generally appear to be healthy. Palpation of the abdomen may reveal\\ntenderness, particularly in the left lower quadrant, at times associated with a palpable, tender sigmoid. A\\ndigital rectal examination, including a test for occult blood, should be done on all patients. In women, a\\npelvic examination helps rule out ovarian tumors and cysts or endometriosis, which may mimic IBS.\\nTesting: The diagnosis of IBS can reasonably be made using the Rome criteria as long as patients have\\nno red flag findings, such as rectal bleeding, weight loss, and fever, or other findings that might suggest\\nanother etiology. Many patients with IBS are overtested; however, CBC, biochemical profile (including\", 'liver tests), ESR, stool examination for ova and parasites (in those with diarrhea predominance), thyroid-\\nstimulating hormone and Ca for those with constipation, and flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition\\nChapter 18.

During flexible fiber-optic proctosigmoidoscopy, introduction of the instrument and air\\ninsufflation frequently trigger bowel spasm and pain. The mucosal and vascular patterns in IBS usually\\nappear normal. Colonoscopy is preferred for patients > 50 with a change in bowel habits, particularly\\nthose with no previous IBS symptoms, to exclude colonic polyps and tumors. In patients with chronic\\ndiarrhea, particularly older women, mucosal biopsy can rule out possible microscopic colitis.\\nAdditional studies (such as ultrasound, CT, barium enema x-ray, upper GI esophagogastroduodenoscopy,\\nand small-bowel x-rays) should be undertaken only when there are other objective abnormalities. Fecal\\nfat excretion should be measured when there is a concern about steatorrhea. Testing for celiac sprue and\\nsmall-bowel x-rays are recommended when malabsorption is suspected. Testing for carbohydrate\\nintolerance should be considered in appropriate circumstances.\\nIntercurrent disease: Patients with IBS may subsequently develop additional GI disorders, and the\\nclinician must not summarily dismiss their complaints. Changes in symptoms (eg, in the location, type, or\\nintensity of pain; in bowel habits; in constipation and diarrhea) and new symptoms or complaints (eg,\\nnocturnal diarrhea) may signal another disease process. Other symptoms that require investigation\\ninclude fresh blood in the stool, weight loss, very severe abdominal pain or unusual abdominal distention,\\nsteatorrhea or noticeably foul-smelling stools, fever or chills, persistent vomiting, hematemesis, symptoms\\nthat wake the patient from sleep (eg, pain, the urge to defecate), and a steady progressive worsening of\\nsymptoms.

Patients should be invited to express not only their symptoms but also their understanding\\nof their symptoms and the reasons prompting a visit to the health care practitioner (eg, fear of serious\\ndisease). Patients should be educated about the disorder (eg, normal bowel physiology and the bowel's\\nhypersensitivity to stress and food) and reassured, after appropriate tests, about the absence of a serious\\nor life-threatening disease. Appropriate therapeutic goals (eg, expectations regarding the normal course\\nor variability in symptoms, adverse effects of drugs, the appropriate and available working relationship\\nbetween the physician and the patient) should be established. Finally, patients can benefit by being\\nactively involved in the management of their condition. When successful, this can enhance the patient's\\nmotivation to adhere to treatment, foster a more positive physician-patient relationship, and mobilize the\\ncoping resources of even the most chronically passive patients. Psychologic stress, anxiety, or mood\\ndisorders should be identified, evaluated, and treated. Regular physical activity helps relieve stress and\\nassists in bowel function, particularly in patients with constipation.\\nDiet: In general, a normal diet should be followed. Meals should not be overly large, and eating should be\\nslow and paced. Patients with abdominal distention and increased flatulence may benefit from reducing or\\neliminating beans, cabbage, and other foods containing fermentable carbohydrates. Reduced intake of\\nsweeteners (eg, sorbitol, mannitol, fructose), which are constituents of natural and processed foods (eg,\\napple and grape juice, bananas, nuts, and raisins), may alleviate flatulence, bloating, and diarrhea.\\nPatients with evidence of lactose intolerance should reduce their intake of milk and dairy products.

Anticholinergic drugs (eg,\\nhyoscyamine 0.125 mg po 30 to 60 min before meals) may be used for their antispasmodic effects.\\nSerotonin receptor modulation may be of benefit. Tegaserod, a 5HT4 agonist, stimulates motility and\\nalleviates constipation.

The dose of loperamide should be titrated upward to reduce diarrhea while avoiding constipation.\\nFor many patients, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) help relieve symptoms of diarrhea, abdominal pain,\\nand bloating. These drugs are thought to reduce pain by down-regulating the activity of spinal cord and\\ncortical afferent pathways arriving from the intestine. Secondary amine TCAs (eg, nortriptyline,\\ndesipramine) are often better tolerated than parent tertiary amines (eg, amitriptyline, imipramine, doxepin)\\nbecause of fewer anticholinergic, sedating antihistaminic, and α-adrenergic adverse effects.

Inflammatory Bowel Disease\\nIntroduction\\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (UC), is a\\nrelapsing and remitting condition characterized by chronic inflammation at various sites in the GI tract,\\nwhich results in diarrhea and abdominal pain.\\nInflammation results from a cell-mediated immune response in the GI mucosa. The precise etiology is\\nunknown, but evidence suggests that the normal intestinal flora trigger an immune reaction in patients\\nwith a multifactorial genetic predisposition (perhaps involving abnormal epithelial barriers and mucosal\\nimmune defenses). No specific environmental, dietary, or infectious causes have been identified. The\\nimmune reaction involves the release of inflammatory mediators, including cytokines, interleukins, and\\ntumor necrosis factor (TNF).\\nAlthough Crohn's disease and UC are similar, they can be distinguished in most cases (see\\nTable 19-1). About 10% of colitis cases are considered indeterminate. The term colitis applies only to\\ninflammatory disease of the colon (eg, ulcerative, granulomatous, ischemic, radiation-induced, infectious).\\nSpastic (mucous) colitis is a misnomer sometimes applied to a functional disorder, irritable bowel\\nsyndrome (see p. 162).\\nEpidemiology: IBD affects people of all ages but usually begins before age 30, with peak incidence from\\n14 to 24. IBD may have a second smaller peak between ages 50 and 70; however, this later peak may\\ninclude some cases of ischemic colitis.\\nIBD is most common among people of Northern European and Anglo-Saxon origin and is 2 to 4 times\\nmore common among Ashkenazi Jews than in non-Jewish whites. The incidence is lower in central and\\nsouthern Europe and lower still in South America, Asia, and Africa. However, the incidence is increasing\\namong blacks and Latin Americans living in North America. Both sexes are equally affected. First-degree\\nrelatives of patients with IBD have a 4- to 20-fold increased risk; their absolute risk may be as high as\\n7%. Familial tendency is much higher in Crohn's disease than in UC.\", \"[Table 19-1. Differentiating Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis]\\nSeveral gene mutations conferring a higher risk of Crohn's disease (and some possibly related to UC)\\nhave been identified.\\nCigarette smoking seems to contribute to development or exacerbation of Crohn's disease but decreases\\nrisk of UC. NSAIDs may exacerbate IBD.\\nExtraintestinal Manifestations\\nCrohn's disease and UC both affect organs other than the intestines. Most extraintestinal manifestations\\nare more common in UC and Crohn's colitis than in Crohn's disease limited to the small bowel.\\nExtraintestinal manifestations are categorized in 3 ways:\\n1. Disorders that usually parallel (ie, wax and wane with) IBD flare-ups. These disorders include\\nperipheral arthritis, episcleritis, aphthous stomatitis, erythema nodosum, and pyoderma gangrenosum.\\nArthritis tends to involve large joints and be migratory and transient. One or more of these parallel\\ndisorders develops in more than one third of patients hospitalized with IBD.\\n2. Disorders that are clearly associated with IBD but appear independently of IBD activity. These\\ndisorders include ankylosing spondylitis, sacroiliitis, uveitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis.\\nAnkylosing spondylitis occurs more commonly in IBD patients with the HLA-B27 antigen. Most patients\\nwith spinal or sacroiliac involvement have evidence of uveitis and vice versa. Primary sclerosing\\ncholangitis, which is a risk factor for cancer of the biliary tract, is strongly associated with UC or Crohn's\\ncolitis. Cholangitis may appear before or concurrently with the bowel disease or even 20 yr after\\ncolectomy.

Some of these\\nconditions (eg, primary sclerosing cholangitis) may precede IBD by many years and, when diagnosed,\\nshould prompt an evaluation for IBD.\\n3. Disorders that are consequences of disrupted bowel physiology. These disorders occur mainly in\\nsevere Crohn's disease of the small bowel. Malabsorption may result from extensive ileal resection and\\ncause deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins, vitamin B12, or minerals, resulting in anemia, hypocalcemia,\\nhypomagnesemia, clotting disorders, and bone demineralization. In children, malabsorption retards\\ngrowth and development. Other disorders include kidney stones from excessive dietary oxalate\\nabsorption, hydroureter and hydronephrosis from ureteral compression by the intestinal inflammatory\\nprocess, gallstones from impaired ileal reabsorption of bile salts, and amyloidosis secondary to long-\\nstanding inflammatory and suppurative disease.\\nThromboembolic disease may occur as a result of multiple factors in all 3 categories.\\nTreatment\\n• Supportive care\\n• 5-Aminosalicylic acid\\n• Corticosteroids\\n• Immunomodulating drugs\\n• Anticytokine drugs\\n• Sometimes antibiotics (eg, metronidazole, ciprofloxacin) and probiotics\\nSeveral classes of drugs are helpful for IBD. Details of their selection and use are discussed under each\\ndisorder.\\n5-Aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA, mesalamine): 5-ASA blocks production of prostaglandins and\\nleukotrienes and has other beneficial effects on the inflammatory cascade. Because 5-ASA is active only\\nintraluminally and is rapidly absorbed by the proximal small bowel, it must be formulated for delayed\\nabsorption when given orally. Sulfasalazine, the original agent in this class, delays absorption by\\ncomplexing 5-ASA with a sulfa moiety, sulfapyridine. The complex is cleaved by bacterial flora in the lower\\nileum and colon, releasing the 5-ASA. The sulfa moiety, however, causes numerous adverse effects (eg,\", 'nausea, dyspepsia, headache), interferes with folate (folic acid) absorption, and occasionally causes\\nserious adverse reactions (eg, hemolytic anemia or agranulocytosis and, rarely, hepatitis or pneumonitis).\\nReversible decreases in sperm count and motility occur in up to 80% of men. If used, sulfasalazine should\\nbe given with food, initially in a low dosage (eg, 0.5 g po bid) and gradually increased over several days\\nto 1 to 2 g bid to tid. Patients should take daily folate supplements 1 mg po and have CBC and liver tests\\nevery 6 to 12 mo. Acute interstitial nephritis secondary to mesalamine occurs rarely; periodic monitoring of\\nrenal function is advisable because most cases are reversible if recognized early.\\nNewer drugs that complex 5-ASA with other vehicles seem almost equally effective but have fewer\\nadverse effects. Olsalazine (a 5-ASA dimer) and balsalazide (5-ASA conjugated to an inactive compound)\\nare cleaved by bacterial azoreductases (as is sulfasalazine). These drugs are activated mainly in the\\ncolon and are less effective for proximal small-bowel disease. Olsalazine dosage is 500 to 1500 mg po\\nbid, and balsalazide is 2.25 g po tid. Olsalazine sometimes causes diarrhea, especially in patients with\\npancolitis. This problem is minimized by gradual escalation of dose and administration with meals.\\nOther forms of 5-ASA use delayed-release coatings. Asacol (typical dose 800 to 1200 mg po tid) is 5-ASA\\ncoated with an acrylic polymer whose pH solubility delays release of the drug until entry into the distal\\nileum and colon. Pentasa (1 g po qid) is 5-ASA encapsulated in ethylcellulose microgranules that release\\n35% of the drug in the small bowel. Two once/day formulations of mesalamine (Lialda, Apriso) are\\navailable; this less frequent dosing may improve adherence.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition\\nChapter 19.

Signs\\nof bone marrow suppression must be monitored with regular WBC count (biweekly for 1 mo, then every 1\\nto 2 mo). Pancreatitis or high fever occurs in about 3 to 5% of patients; either is an absolute\\ncontraindication to rechallenge. Hepatotoxicity is rarer and can be screened by blood tests every 6 to 12\\nmo.

These mucosal lesions may develop into deep longitudinal and transverse ulcers with intervening\\nmucosal edema, creating a characteristic cobblestoned appearance to the bowel.\\nTransmural spread of inflammation leads to lymphedema and thickening of the bowel wall and mesentery.\\nMesenteric fat typically extends onto the serosal surface of the bowel. Mesenteric lymph nodes often\\nenlarge. Extensive inflammation may result in hypertrophy of the muscularis mucosae, fibrosis, and\\nstricture formation, which can lead to bowel obstruction. Abscesses are common, and fistulas often\\npenetrate into adjoining structures, including other loops of bowel, the bladder, or psoas muscle. Fistulas\\nmay even extend to the skin of the anterior abdomen or flanks. Independently of intra-abdominal disease\\nactivity, perianal fistulas and abscesses occur in 25 to 33% of cases; these complications are frequently\\nthe most troublesome aspects of Crohn\\'s disease.\\nNoncaseating granulomas can occur in lymph nodes, peritoneum, the liver, and all layers of the bowel\\nwall. Although pathognomonic when present, granulomas are not detected in about half of patients with\\nCrohn\\'s disease. The presence of granulomas does not seem to be related to the clinical course.\\nSegments of diseased bowel are sharply demarcated from adjacent normal bowel (\"skip areas\"); hence,\\nthe name regional enteritis. About 35% of Crohn\\'s disease cases involve the ileum alone (ileitis); about\\n45% involve the ileum and colon (ileocolitis), with a predilection for the right side of the colon; and about\\n20% involve the colon alone (granulomatous colitis), most of which, unlike ulcerative colitis (UC), spare\\nthe rectum.

In the absence of surgical intervention, the disease\\nalmost never extends into areas of small bowel that are not involved at first diagnosis.\\nThere is an increased risk of cancer in affected small-bowel segments. Patients with colonic involvement\\nhave a long-term risk of colorectal cancer equal to that of UC, given the same extent and duration of\\ndisease.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nThe most common initial manifestation is chronic diarrhea with abdominal pain, fever, anorexia, and\\nweight loss. The abdomen is tender, and a mass or fullness may be palpable. Gross rectal bleeding is\\nunusual except in isolated colonic disease, which may manifest similarly to UC. Some patients present\\nwith an acute abdomen that simulates acute appendicitis or intestinal obstruction. About 33% of patients\\nhave perianal disease (especially fissures and fistulas), which is sometimes the most prominent or even\\ninitial complaint. In children, extraintestinal manifestations frequently predominate over GI symptoms;\\narthritis, FUO, anemia, or growth retardation may be a presenting symptom, whereas abdominal pain or\\ndiarrhea may be absent.\\nWith recurrent disease, symptoms vary. Pain is most common and occurs with both simple recurrence and\\nabscess formation. Patients with severe flare-up or abscess are likely to have marked tenderness,\\nguarding, rebound, and a general toxic appearance. Stenotic segments may cause bowel obstruction,\\nwith colicky pain, distention, obstipation, and vomiting. Adhesions from previous surgery may also cause\\nbowel obstruction, which begins rapidly, without the prodrome of fever, pain, and malaise typical of\\nobstruction due to a Crohn's disease flare-up.

However, if the dysplasia is unequivocal, delaying colectomy in favor of repeated follow-up\\nsurveillance is a risky strategy. Pseudopolyps have no prognostic significance but may be difficult to\\ndistinguish from neoplastic polyps; thus, any suspect polyp should undergo excision biopsy.\\nThe optimal frequency of colonoscopic surveillance has not been established, but some authorities\\nrecommend every 2 yr during the 2nd decade of disease and annually thereafter.\\nLong-term survival after diagnosis of colitis-related cancer is about 50%, a figure comparable to that for\\ncolorectal cancer in the general population.', 'colorectal cancer in the general population.\\nTreatment\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition\\nChapter 19.

Diverticular Disease\\nIntroduction\\nDiverticula are saclike mucosal outpouchings that protrude from a tubular structure. True diverticula\\ncontain all layers of the parent structure. False or pseudodiverticula are mucosal projections through the\\nmuscular layer. Esophageal (see p. 125) and Meckel's diverticula are true diverticula. Colonic diverticula\\nare pseudodiverticula; they cause symptoms by trapping feces and becoming inflamed or infected,\\nbleeding, or rupturing.\\nDiverticulosis\\nDiverticulosis is the presence of multiple diverticula in the colon, probably resulting from a\\nlifelong low-fiber diet. Most diverticula are asymptomatic, but some become inflamed or bleed.\\nDiagnosis is by colonoscopy or barium enema. Treatment varies depending on manifestation.\\nDiverticula occur anywhere in the large bowel—usually in the sigmoid but rarely below the peritoneal\\nreflection of the rectum. They vary in diameter from 3 mm to > 3 cm. Patients with diverticula usually have\\nseveral of them. Diverticulosis is uncommon in people < 40 but becomes common rapidly thereafter;\\nessentially every 90-yr-old person has many diverticula. Giant diverticula, which are rare, range in\\ndiameter from 3 to 15 cm and may be single.\\nPathophysiology\\nDiverticula are probably caused by increased intraluminal pressure leading to mucosal extrusion through\\nthe weakest points of the muscular layer of the bowel—areas adjacent to intramural blood vessels.\\nDiverticula are more common among people who eat a low-fiber diet; however, the mechanism is not\\nclear. One theory is that increased intraluminal pressure is required to move low-bulk stool through the\\ncolon. Another theory is that low-stool bulk causes a smaller diameter colon, which by Laplace's law\\nwould have increased pressure.\\nThe etiology of giant diverticula is unclear. One theory is that a valvelike abnormality exists at the base of\\nthe diverticulum, so bowel gas can enter but escapes less freely.\\nSymptoms and Signs\", 'the diverticulum, so bowel gas can enter but escapes less freely.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nMost (70%) diverticula are asymptomatic, 15 to 25% become painfully inflamed (diverticulitis), and 10 to\\n15% bleed painlessly. The bleeding is probably caused by erosion of the adjacent vessel by local trauma\\nfrom impacted feces in the diverticulum. Although most diverticula are distal, 75% of bleeding occurs from\\ndiverticula proximal to the splenic flexure. In 33% of patients (5% overall), bleeding is serious enough to\\nrequire transfusion.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Usually colonoscopy\\nAsymptomatic diverticula are usually found incidentally during barium enema or colonoscopy.\\nDiverticulosis is suspected when painless rectal bleeding develops, particularly in an elderly patient.\\nEvaluation of rectal bleeding typically includes colonoscopy, which can be done electively after routine\\npreparation unless there is significant ongoing bleeding. In such patients, a rapid preparation (5 to 10 L of\\npolyethylene glycol solution delivered via NGT over 3 to 4 h) often allows adequate visualization. If\\ncolonoscopy cannot visualize the source and ongoing bleeding is sufficiently rapid (> 0.5 to 1 mL/min),\\nangiography may localize the source.

The intuitive\\ninjunction to avoid seeds or other dietary material that might become impacted in a diverticulum has no\\nestablished medical basis. Antispasmodics (eg, belladonna) are not of benefit and may cause adverse\\neffects. Surgery is unwarranted for uncomplicated disease. Giant diverticula, however, require surgery.\\nDiverticular bleeding stops spontaneously in 75% of patients. Treatment is often given during diagnostic\\nprocedures. If angiography was done for diagnosis, ongoing bleeding can be controlled in 70 to 90% of\\npatients by intraarterial injection of vasopressin. In some cases, bleeding recurs within a few days and\\nrequires surgery. Angiographic embolization effectively stops bleeding but leads to bowel infarction in up\\nto 20% of patients and is not recommended. Colonoscopy allows heat or laser coagulation of vessels or\\ninjection of epinephrine. If these measures fail to stop bleeding, segmental resection or subtotal\\ncolectomy is indicated.\\nDiverticulitis\\nDiverticulitis is inflammation of a diverticulum, which can result in phlegmon of the bowel wall,\\nperitonitis, perforation, fistula, or abscess. The primary symptom is abdominal pain. Diagnosis\\nis by CT. Treatment is with antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, or a 3rd-generation cephalosporin plus\\nmetronidazole) and occasionally surgery.\\nDiverticulitis occurs when a micro or macro perforation develops in a diverticulum, releasing intestinal\\nbacteria. The resultant inflammation remains localized in about 75% of patients. The remaining 25% may\\ndevelop abscess, free intraperitoneal perforation, bowel obstruction, or fistulas. The most common\\nfistulas involve the bladder but may also involve the small bowel, uterus, vagina, abdominal wall, or even\\nthe thigh.\\nDiverticulitis is most serious in elderly patients, especially those taking prednisone or other drugs that', 'increase the risk of infection. Nearly all serious diverticulitis occurs in the sigmoid.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nDiverticulitis usually manifests with pain or tenderness in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen and\\nfever. Peritoneal signs (eg, rebound or guarding) may be present, particularly with abscess or free\\nperforation. Fistulas may manifest as pneumaturia, feculent vaginal discharge, or a cutaneous or\\nmyofascial infection of the abdominal wall, perineum, or upper leg.

A colonoscopy or barium enema is done ≥ 2 wk after\\nsymptoms have resolved.\\nSurgery: Surgery is required immediately for patients with free perforation or general peritonitis and for\\npatients with severe symptoms that do not respond to nonsurgical treatment within 48 h. Increasing pain,\\ntenderness, and fever are other signs that surgery is needed. Surgery should also be considered in\\npatients with any of the following: ≥ 2 previous attacks of mild diverticulitis (or one attack in a patient <\\n50); a persistent tender mass; clinical, endoscopic, or x-ray signs suggestive of cancer; and dysuria\\nassociated with diverticulitis in men (or in women who have had a hysterectomy), because this symptom\\nmay presage perforation into the bladder.\\nThe involved section of the colon is resected.

Other patients have a temporary\\ncolostomy with anastomosis carried out in a subsequent operation after inflammation resolves and the\\npatient's general condition improves.\\nMeckel's Diverticulum\\nMeckel's diverticulum is a congenital sacculation of the distal ileum occurring in 2 to 3% of\\npeople. It is usually located within 100 cm of the ileocecal valve and often contains heterotopic\\ngastric tissue, pancreatic tissue, or both. Symptoms are uncommon but include bleeding, bowel\\nobstruction, and inflammation (diverticulitis). Diagnosis is difficult and often involves\\nradionuclide scanning and barium studies. Treatment is surgical resection.\\nPathophysiology\\nIn early fetal life, the vitelline duct running from the terminal ileum to the umbilicus and yolk sac is normally\\nobliterated by the 7th wk. If the portion connecting to the ileum fails to atrophy, a Meckel's diverticulum\\nresults. This congenital diverticulum arises from the antimesenteric margin of the intestine and contains\\nall layers of the normal bowel. About 50% of diverticula also contain heterotopic tissue of the stomach\\n(and thus contain parietal cells that secrete HCl), pancreas, or both.\\nOnly about 2% of people with Meckel's diverticulum develop complications.

Obstruction can occur at any age but is\\nmore common among older children and adults. In children, obstruction is most likely caused by\\nintussusception of the diverticulum. Obstruction may also result from adhesions, volvulus, retained foreign\\nbodies, tumors, or incarceration in a hernia (Littre's hernia). Acute Meckel's diverticulitis can occur at any\\nage, but its incidence peaks in older children.

Patients presenting with abdominal pain and focal tenderness should\\nhave a CT scan with oral contrast. If vomiting and signs of obstruction are predominant, flat and upright x-\\nrays of the abdomen are done. Sometimes diagnosis is made only during surgical exploration for\\npresumed appendicitis; whenever a normal appendix is found, Meckel's diverticulum should be\\nsuspected.\\nTreatment\\n• Surgery\\nPatients with intestinal obstruction caused by Meckel's diverticulum require early surgery.

The canal\\nis lined with anoderm, a continuation of the external skin. The anal canal and adjacent skin are\\ninnervated by somatic sensory nerves and are highly susceptible to painful stimuli. Venous drainage from\\nthe anal canal occurs through the caval system, but the anorectal junction can drain into both the portal\\nand caval systems. Lymphatics from the anal canal pass to the internal iliac nodes, the posterior vaginal\\nwall, and the inguinal nodes. The venous and lymphatic distributions determine how malignant disease\\nand infection spread.\\nThe rectum is a continuation of the sigmoid colon beginning at the level of the 3rd sacral vertebra and\\ncontinuing to the anorectal junction. The rectal lining consists of red, glistening glandular mucosa, which\\nhas an autonomic nerve supply and is relatively insensitive to pain. Venous drainage occurs through the\\nportal system. Lymphatic return from the rectum occurs along the superior hemorrhoidal vascular pedicle\\nto the inferior mesenteric and aortic nodes.\\nThe sphincteric ring encircling the anal canal is composed of the internal sphincter, the central portion of\\nthe levators, and components of the external sphincter. Anteriorly, it is more vulnerable to trauma, which\\ncan result in incontinence. The puborectalis forms a muscular sling around the rectum for support and\\nassistance in defecation.\\nHistory: History should include the details of bleeding, pain, protrusion, discharge, swelling, abnormal\\nsensations, bowel movements, incontinence, stool characteristics, use of cathartics and enemas, and\\nabdominal and urinary symptoms.

Anoscopy and rigid or flexible sigmoidoscopy to 15 to 60 cm above the anal verge are often\\nincluded (see p. 98). Inspection, palpation, and anoscopy and sigmoidoscopy are best done with the\\npatient in the left lateral (Sims') position or inverted on a tilt table. In cases of painful anal lesions, topical\\n(lidocaine 5% ointment), regional, or even general anesthesia may be required.

Leiomyoma, the\\nmost common, may be multiple but usually has an excellent prognosis.\\nEsophageal Cancer\\nThe most common malignant tumor in the proximal two thirds of the esophagus is squamous\\ncell carcinoma; adenocarcinoma is the most common in the distal one third. Symptoms are\\nprogressive dysphagia and weight loss. Diagnosis is by endoscopy, followed by CT and\\nendoscopic ultrasound for staging. Treatment varies with stage and generally includes surgery\\nwith or without chemotherapy and radiation. Long-term survival is poor except for those with\\nlocal disease.\\nEsophageal cancer accounts for an estimated 15,500 cases and 13,900 deaths in the US annually.\\nSquamous cell carcinoma: About 8000 cases occur annually in the US. It is more common in parts of\\nAsia and in South Africa. In the US, it is 4 to 5 times more common among blacks than whites, and 2 to 3\\ntimes more common among men than women.\\nThe primary risk factors are alcohol ingestion and tobacco use (in any form). Other factors include\\nachalasia, human papillomavirus, lye ingestion (resulting in stricture), sclerotherapy, Plummer-Vinson\\nsyndrome, irradiation of the esophagus, and esophageal webs. Genetic causes are unclear, but 50% of\\npatients with tylosis (hyperkeratosis palmaris et plantaris), an autosomal dominant disorder, have\\nesophageal cancer by age 45, and 95% have it by age 55.\\nAdenocarcinoma: Adenocarcinoma occurs in the distal esophagus. Its incidence is increasing; it\\naccounts for 50% of esophageal carcinoma in whites. It is 4 times more common among whites than', \"blacks. Alcohol is not an important risk factor, but smoking is contributory. Adenocarcinoma of the distal\\nesophagus is difficult to distinguish from adenocarcinoma of the gastric cardia invading the distal\\nesophagus.\\nMost adenocarcinomas arise in Barrett's esophagus, which results from chronic gastroesophageal reflux\\ndisease and reflux esophagitis. In Barrett's esophagus, a metaplastic, columnar, glandular, intestine-like\\nmucosa with brush border and goblet cells replaces the normal stratified squamous epithelium of the\\ndistal esophagus during the healing phase of acute esophagitis when healing takes place in the\\ncontinued presence of stomach acid.\\nOther malignant tumors: Less common malignant tumors include spindle cell carcinoma (a poorly\\ndifferentiated variant of squamous cell carcinoma), verrucous carcinoma (a well-differentiated variant of\\nsquamous cell carcinoma), pseudosarcoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma,\\ncylindroma (adenoid cystic carcinoma), primary oat cell carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, carcinoid tumor,\\nsarcoma, and primary malignant melanoma.\\nMetastatic cancer constitutes 3% of esophageal cancer. Melanoma and breast cancer are most likely to\\nmetastasize to the esophagus; others include cancers of the head and neck, lung, stomach, liver, kidney,\\nprostate, testis, and bone.

Occasionally, a biopsy limited to the mucosa misses tumor tissue in the submucosa. X-rays,\\nparticularly double-contrast barium studies, may show lesions but rarely obviate the need for subsequent\\nendoscopy.\\nPatients in whom cancer is identified require CT of the chest and abdomen to determine extent of tumor\\nspread. If CT is negative for metastasis, endoscopic ultrasound should be done to determine the depth of\\nthe tumor and regional lymph node involvement. Findings guide therapy and help determine prognosis.\\nBasic blood tests, including CBC, electrolytes, and liver function tests, should be done to assess anemia,', 'hydration, general condition, and possible liver metastases. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) should be\\nmeasured before and after surgery.\\nScreening: Screening with endoscopy is used in high-risk populations (eg, Japanese) but is not\\nrecommended in the US. Follow-up screening for recurrence in treated patients consists of endoscopy\\nand CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. If an elevated CEA dropped after surgery, follow-up should\\ninclude CEA levels; a rise signifies recurrence.\\nPrognosis\\nPrognosis depends greatly on stage but overall is poor (5-yr survival: < 5 to 15%) because most patients\\npresent with advanced disease. If the tumor is limited to the mucosa or submucosa, 5-yr survival may be\\nas high as 80%. For tumors involving local lymph nodes, survival is 20 to 40%.

However, the true extent of tumor spread often is not recognized until curative\\nsurgery is attempted. Palliative surgery typically consists of a gastroenterostomy to bypass a pyloric\\nobstruction and should be done only if the patient's quality of life can be improved.

Average age at presentation is 50 to 60.\\nSymptoms vary with location but include bleeding, dyspepsia, and obstruction. Diagnosis is usually by\\nendoscopy, with biopsy and endoscopic ultrasound for staging. Treatment is surgical removal. The role of\\nradiation and chemotherapy is unclear, but the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib has been beneficial.\\nSmall-Bowel Tumors\", \"Small-Bowel Tumors\\nSmall-bowel tumors account for 1 to 5% of GI tumors (over 5000 cases in the US annually).\\nBenign tumors include leiomyomas, lipomas, neurofibromas, and fibromas. All may cause abdominal\\ndistention, pain, bleeding, diarrhea, and, if obstruction develops, vomiting. Polyps are not as common as\\nin the colon.\\nAdenocarcinoma, a malignant tumor, is uncommon. Usually it arises in the duodenum or proximal\\njejunum and causes minimal symptoms. In patients with Crohn's disease, the tumors tend to occur distally\\nand in bypassed or inflamed loops of bowel; adenocarcinoma occurs more often in Crohn's disease of the\\nsmall bowel than in Crohn's disease of the colon.\\nPrimary malignant lymphoma (see p. 1016) arising in the ileum may cause a long, rigid segment.

Treatment depends on the cell type and location and extent of the lesions.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Enteroclysis\\n• Sometimes push endoscopy or capsule video endoscopy\\nEnteroclysis (sometimes CT enteroclysis) is probably the most common study for mass lesions of the\\nsmall bowel. Push endoscopy of the small bowel with an enteroscope may be used to visualize and\\nbiopsy tumors. Capsule video endoscopy can help identify small-bowel lesions, particularly bleeding sites;\\na swallowed capsule transmits 2 images/sec to an external recorder. The original capsule is not useful in\\nthe stomach or colon because it tumbles in these larger organs; a colon capsule camera with better optics\\nand illumination is under development for use in these larger-diameter organs.\\nTreatment\\n• Surgical resection\\nTreatment is surgical resection. Electrocautery, thermal obliteration, or laser phototherapy at the time of\\nenteroscopy or surgery may be an alternative to resection.\\nPolyps of the Colon and Rectum\\nAn intestinal polyp is any mass of tissue that arises from the bowel wall and protrudes into the\\nlumen. Most are asymptomatic except for minor bleeding, which is usually occult. The main\\nconcern is malignant transformation; most colon cancers arise in a previously benign\\nadenomatous polyp. Diagnosis is by endoscopy. Treatment is endoscopic removal.\\nPolyps may be sessile or pedunculated and vary considerably in size. Incidence of polyps ranges from 7\\nto 50%; the higher figure includes very small polyps (usually hyperplastic polyps or adenomas) found at\\nautopsy. Polyps, often multiple, occur most commonly in the rectum and sigmoid and decrease in\\nfrequency toward the cecum. Multiple polyps may represent familial adenomatous polyposis (see p. 192).', \"About 25% of patients with cancer of the large bowel also have satellite adenomatous polyps.\\nAdenomatous (neoplastic) polyps are of greatest concern. Such lesions are classified histologically as\\ntubular adenomas, tubulo-villous adenomas (villoglandular polyps), or villous adenomas. The likelihood of\\ncancer in an adenomatous polyp at the time of discovery is related to size, histologic type, and degree of\\ndysplasia; a 1.5-cm tubular adenoma has a 2% risk of containing a cancer vs a 35% risk in 3-cm villous\\nadenomas. Serrated adenomas, a somewhat more aggressive type of adenoma, may develop from\\nhyperplastic polyps.\\nNonadenomatous (nonneoplastic) polyps include hyperplastic polyps, hamartomas, juvenile polyps,\\npseudopolyps, lipomas, leiomyomas, and other rarer tumors. Juvenile polyps occur in children, typically\\noutgrow their blood supply, and autoamputate some time during or after puberty. Treatment is required\\nonly for uncontrollable bleeding or intussusception. Inflammatory polyps and pseudopolyps occur in\\nchronic ulcerative colitis and in Crohn's disease of the colon. Multiple juvenile polyps (but not sporadic\\nones) convey an increased cancer risk. The specific number of polyps resulting in increased risk is not\\nknown.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nMost polyps are asymptomatic. Rectal bleeding, usually occult and rarely massive, is the most frequent\\ncomplaint. Cramps, abdominal pain, or obstruction may occur with a large lesion.

Barium enema, particularly double-contrast examination, is\\neffective, but colonoscopy is preferred because polyps also may be removed during that procedure.\\nBecause rectal polyps are often multiple and may coexist with cancer, complete colonoscopy to the\\ncecum is mandatory even if a distal lesion is found by flexible sigmoidoscopy.\\nTreatment\\n• Complete removal during colonoscopy\\n• Sometimes follow with surgical resection\\n• Follow-up surveillance colonoscopy\\nPolyps should be removed completely with a snare or electrosurgical biopsy forceps during total\\ncolonoscopy; complete excision is particularly important for large villous adenomas, which have a high\\npotential for cancer. If colonoscopic removal is unsuccessful, laparotomy should be done.\\nSubsequent treatment depends on the histology of the polyp. If dysplastic epithelium does not invade the\\nmuscularis mucosa, the line of resection in the polyp's stalk is clear, and the lesion is well differentiated,\\nendoscopic excision and close endoscopic follow-up should suffice. Patients with deeper invasion, an\\nunclear resection line, or a poorly differentiated lesion should have segmental resection of the colon.\\nBecause invasion through the muscularis mucosa provides access to lymphatics and increases the\\npotential for lymph node metastasis, such patients should have further evaluation (as in colon cancer\\n—see p. 193).\\nThe scheduling of follow-up examinations after polypectomy is controversial. Most authorities recommend\\ntotal colonoscopy annually for 2 yr (or barium enema if total colonoscopy is impossible), with removal of\\nnewly discovered lesions.

Treatment is\\ncolectomy.\\nFAP is an autosomal dominant disease in which ≥ 100 adenomatous polyps carpet the colon and rectum.\\nThe disorder occurs in 1 in 8,000 to 14,000 people. Polyps are present in 50% of patients by age 15, and\\n95% by 35. Cancer develops before age 40 in nearly all untreated patients.\\nPatients also can develop various extracolonic manifestations (previously termed Gardner's syndrome),\\nboth benign and malignant. Benign manifestations include desmoid tumors, osteomas of the skull or\\nmandible, sebaceous cysts, and adenomas in other parts of the GI tract.

By diagnosis, 90% of patients have locally advanced tumors that have involved\\nretroperitoneal structures, spread to regional lymph nodes, or metastasized to the liver or lung.\\nMost patients have severe upper abdominal pain, which usually radiates to the back. The pain may be\\nrelieved by bending forward or assuming the fetal position. Weight loss is common. Adenocarcinomas of\\nthe head of the pancreas cause obstructive jaundice (often causing pruritus) in 80 to 90% of patients.\\nCancer in the body and tail may cause splenic vein obstruction, resulting in splenomegaly, gastric and\\nesophageal varices, and GI hemorrhage. The cancer causes diabetes in 25 to 50% of patients, leading to\\nsymptoms of glucose intolerance (eg, polyuria and polydipsia).\\nDiagnosis\\n• CT or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)\\n• CA 19-9 antigen to follow (not for screening)\\nThe preferred tests are an abdominal helical CT or MRCP. If CT or MRCP shows apparent unresectable', 'or metastatic disease, a percutaneous needle aspiration of an accessible lesion might be considered to\\nobtain a tissue diagnosis. If CT shows a potentially resectable tumor or no tumor, MRCP or endoscopic\\nultrasound may be used to stage disease or detect small tumors not visible with CT. Patients with\\nobstructive jaundice may have ERCP as the first diagnostic procedure.\\nRoutine laboratory tests should be done. Elevation of alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin indicate bile duct\\nobstruction or liver metastases. Pancreas-associated antigen CA 19-9 may be used to monitor patients\\ndiagnosed with pancreatic carcinoma and to screen those at high risk. However, this test is not sensitive\\nor specific enough to be used for population screening. Elevated levels should drop with successful\\ntreatment; subsequent increases indicate progression. Amylase and lipase levels are usually normal.\\nPrognosis\\nPrognosis varies with stage but overall is poor (5-yr survival: < 2%), because many patients have\\nadvanced disease at the time of diagnosis.\\nTreatment\\n• Whipple procedure\\n• Adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition\\nChapter 22.

Depending on location of the tumor, the procedure of\\nchoice is most commonly a Whipple procedure (pancreatoduodenectomy). Adjuvant therapy with 5-\\nfluorouracil (5-FU) and external beam radiation therapy is typically given, resulting in about 40% 2-yr and\\n25% 5-yr survival. This combination is also used for patients with localized but unresectable tumors and\\nresults in median survival of about 1 yr. Newer drugs (eg, gemcitabine, irinotecan, paclitaxel, oxaliplatin,\\ncarboplatin) may be more effective than 5-FU-based chemotherapy, but no drug, singly or in combination,\\nis clearly superior in prolonging survival. Patients with hepatic or distant metastases may be offered\\nchemotherapy as part of an investigational program, but the outlook is dismal with or without such\\ntreatment and some patients may choose to forego it.\\nIf an unresectable tumor is found at operation and gastroduodenal or bile duct obstruction is present or\\npending, a double gastric and biliary bypass operation is usually done to relieve obstruction. In patients\\nwith inoperable lesions and jaundice, endoscopic placement of a bile duct stent relieves jaundice.\\nHowever, surgical bypass should be considered in patients with unresectable lesions if life expectancy is\\n> 6 to 7 mo because of complications associated with stents.\\nSymptomatic treatment: Ultimately, most patients experience pain and die. Thus, symptomatic\\ntreatment is as important as controlling disease. Appropriate end-of-life care should be discussed (see\\nalso p. 3480).\\nPatients with moderate to severe pain should receive an oral opioid in doses adequate to provide relief.\\nConcern about addiction should not be a barrier to effective pain control. For chronic pain, long-acting\\npreparations (eg, transdermal fentanyl, oxycodone, oxymorphone) are usually best. Percutaneous or\\noperative splanchnic (celiac) block effectively controls pain in most patients. In cases of intolerable pain,', 'opioids given sc or by IV, epidural, or intrathecal infusion provides additional relief.\\nIf palliative surgery or endoscopic placement of a biliary stent fails to relieve pruritus secondary to\\nobstructive jaundice, the patient can be managed with cholestyramine (4 g po once/day to qid).\\nPhenobarbital 30 to 60 mg po tid to qid may be helpful.\\nExocrine pancreatic insufficiency is treated with tablets of porcine pancreatic enzymes (pancrelipase).\\nThe patient should take enough to supply 16,000 to 20,000 lipase units before each meal or snack. If a\\nmeal is prolonged (as in a restaurant), some of the tablets should be taken during the meal. Optimal\\nintraluminal pH for the enzymes is 8; thus, some clinicians give a proton pump inhibitor or H2 blocker 2\\ntimes/day. Diabetes mellitus should be closely monitored and controlled.\\nCystadenocarcinoma\\nCystadenocarcinoma is a rare adenomatous pancreatic cancer that arises as a malignant degeneration of\\na mucous cystadenoma and manifests as upper abdominal pain and a palpable abdominal mass.\\nDiagnosis is made by abdominal CT or MRI, which typically shows a cystic mass containing debris; the\\nmass may be misinterpreted as necrotic adenocarcinoma or pancreatic pseudocyst. Unlike ductal\\nadenocarcinoma, cystadenocarcinoma has a relatively good prognosis. Only 20% of patients have\\nmetastasis at the time of operation; complete excision of the tumor by distal or total pancreatectomy or by\\na Whipple procedure results in a 65% 5-yr survival.\\nIntraductal Papillary-Mucinous Tumor\\nIntraductal papillary-mucinous tumor (IPMT) is a rare cancer resulting in mucus hypersecretion and ductal\\nobstruction.

They have 2 general manifestations. Nonfunctioning tumors may cause obstructive symptoms\\nof the biliary tract or duodenum, bleeding into the GI tract, or abdominal masses. Functioning tumors\\nhypersecrete a particular hormone, causing various syndromes (see\\nTable 22-3). These clinical syndromes can also occur in multiple endocrine neoplasia, in which tumors or\\nhyperplasia affects two or more endocrine glands, usually the parathyroid, pituitary, thyroid, or adrenals\\n(see p. 909).\\nTreatment for functioning and nonfunctioning tumors is surgical resection. If metastases preclude curative\\nsurgery, various antihormone treatments may be tried for functioning tumors. Because of tumor rarity,\\nchemotherapy trials have not identified definitive treatment. However, streptozotocin has selective activity\\nagainst pancreatic islet cells and is commonly used, either alone or in combination with 5-fluorouracil or\\ndoxorubicin. Some centers use chlorozotocin and interferon.\\nInsulinoma\\nAn insulinoma is a rare pancreatic β-cell tumor that hypersecretes insulin. The main symptom is\\nfasting hypoglycemia. Diagnosis is by a 48- or 72-h fast with measurement of glucose and\\ninsulin levels, followed by endoscopic ultrasound. Treatment is surgery when possible. Drugs\\nthat block insulin secretion (eg, diazoxide, octreotide, Ca channel blockers, β-blockers,\\nphenytoin) are used for patients not responding to surgery.\\nOf all insulinomas, 80% are single and may be curatively resected if identified. Only 10% of insulinomas\\nare malignant. Insulinoma occurs in 1/250,000 at a median age of 50 yr, except in multiple endocrine', 'neoplasia (MEN) type I (about 10% of insulinomas), when it occurs in the 20s. Insulinomas associated\\nwith MEN type I are more likely to be multiple.\\nSurreptitious administration of exogenous insulin can cause episodic hypoglycemia mimicking insulinoma.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nHypoglycemia secondary to an insulinoma occurs during fasting.

Approach to the Patient With Liver Disease\\nIntroduction\\nThe liver is the most metabolically complex organ. Hepatocytes (liver parenchymal cells) perform the\\nliver's metabolic functions:\\n• Formation and excretion of bile during bilirubin metabolism (see Sidebar 23-1)\\n• Regulation of carbohydrate homeostasis\\n• Lipid synthesis and secretion of plasma lipoproteins\\n• Control of cholesterol metabolism\\n• Formation of urea, serum albumin, clotting factors, enzymes, and numerous other proteins\\n• Metabolism or detoxification of drugs and other foreign substances\\nAt the cellular level, portal triads consist of adjacent and parallel terminal branches of bile ducts, portal\\nveins, and hepatic arteries that border the hepatocytes (see\\nFig. 23-1). Terminal branches of the hepatic veins are in the center of hepatic lobules. Because blood\\nflows from the portal triads past the hepatocytes and drains via vein branches in the center of the lobule,\\nthe center of the lobule is the area most susceptible to ischemia.\\nPathophysiology\\nLiver disorders can result from a wide variety of insults, including infections, drugs, toxins, ischemia, and\\nautoimmune disorders. Occasionally, liver disorders occur postoperatively (see p. 223). Most liver\\ndisorders cause some degree of hepatocellular injury and necrosis, resulting in various abnormal\\nlaboratory test results and, sometimes, symptoms.\\n[Fig. 23-1. Organization of the liver.]\\nSymptoms may be due to liver disease itself (eg, jaundice due to acute hepatitis) or to complications of\\nliver disease (eg, acute GI bleeding due to cirrhosis and portal hypertension).\\nSidebar 23-1 Overview of Bilirubin Metabolism\\nThe breakdown of heme produces bilirubin (an insoluble waste product) and other bile pigments. Bilirubin\\nmust be made water soluble to be excreted. This transformation occurs in 5 steps: formation, plasma\\ntransport, liver uptake, conjugation, and biliary excretion.\\nFormation: About 250 to 350 mg of unconjugated bilirubin forms daily; 70 to 80% derives from the\", 'breakdown of degenerating RBCs, and 20 to 30% (early-labeled bilirubin) derives primarily from other\\nheme proteins in the bone marrow and liver. Hb is degraded to iron and biliverdin, which is converted to\\nbilirubin.\\nPlasma transport: Unconjugated (indirect-reacting) bilirubin is not water soluble and so is transported in\\nthe plasma bound to albumin. It cannot pass through the glomerular membrane into the urine. Albumin\\nbinding weakens under certain conditions (eg, acidosis), and some substances (eg, salicylates, certain\\nantibiotics) compete for the binding sites.\\nLiver uptake: The liver takes up bilirubin rapidly but does not take up the attached serum albumin.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th EditionChapter 23.

This reaction, catalyzed by the microsomal enzyme glucuronyl\\ntransferase, renders the bilirubin water soluble.\\nBiliary excretion: Tiny canaliculi formed by adjacent hepatocytes progressively coalesce into ductules,\\ninterlobular bile ducts, and larger hepatic ducts. Outside the porta hepatis, the main hepatic duct joins the\\ncystic duct from the gallbladder to form the common bile duct, which drains into the duodenum at the\\nampulla of Vater.\\nConjugated bilirubin is secreted into the bile canaliculus with other bile constituents. In the intestine,\\nbacteria metabolize bilirubin to form urobilinogen, much of which is further metabolized to stercobilins,\\nwhich render the stool brown. In complete biliary obstruction, stools lose their normal color and become\\nlight gray (clay-colored stool). Some urobilinogen is reabsorbed, extracted by hepatocytes, and re-\\nexcreted in bile (enterohepatic circulation). A small amount is excreted in urine.\\nBecause conjugated bilirubin is excreted in urine and unconjugated bilirubin is not, only conjugated\\nhyperbilirubinemia (eg, due to hepatocellular or cholestatic jaundice) causes bilirubinuria.\\nDespite necrosis, the liver can regenerate itself. Even extensive patchy necrosis can resolve completely\\n(eg, in acute viral hepatitis). Incomplete regeneration and fibrosis, however, may result from injury that\\nbridges entire lobules or from less pronounced but ongoing damage.\\nSpecific diseases preferentially affect certain hepatobiliary structures or functions (eg, acute viral hepatitis\\nis primarily manifested by damage to hepatocytes or hepatocellular injury; primary biliary cirrhosis, by\\nimpairment of biliary secretion; and cryptogenic cirrhosis, by liver fibrosis and resultant portal venous', 'hypertension). The part of the hepatobiliary system affected determines the symptoms, signs, and\\nlaboratory abnormalities (see also Ch. 24). Some disorders (eg, severe alcoholic liver disease) affect\\nmultiple liver structures, resulting in a combination of patterns of symptoms, signs, and laboratory\\nabnormalities.\\nThe prognosis of serious complications is worse in older adults, who are less able to recover from severe\\nphysiologic stresses and to tolerate toxic accumulations.\\nEvaluation\\nHistory: Various symptoms may develop, but few are specific for liver disorders:\\n• Common nonspecific symptoms include fatigue, anorexia, nausea, and, occasionally, vomiting,\\nparticularly in severe disorders.\\n• Loose, fatty stools (steatorrhea) can occur when cholestasis prevents sufficient bile from reaching the\\nintestines. Patients with steatorrhea are at risk of deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K).\\nCommon clinical consequences may include osteoporosis and bleeding.\\n• Fever can develop in viral or alcoholic hepatitis.\\n• Jaundice (see p. 212), occurring in both hepatocellular dysfunction and cholestatic disorders, is the\\nmost specific symptom.

Consequences include esophageal\\nvarices and portal-systemic encephalopathy. Diagnosis is based on clinical criteria, often in\\nconjunction with imaging tests and endoscopy. Treatment involves prevention of GI bleeding\\nwith endoscopy, drugs, or both and sometimes with portocaval shunting.\\nThe portal vein, formed by the superior mesenteric and splenic veins, drains blood from the abdominal GI\\ntract, spleen, and pancreas into the liver. Within reticuloendotheliumlined blood channels (sinusoids),\\nblood from the terminal portal venules merges with hepatic arterial blood. Blood flows out of the sinusoids\\nvia the hepatic veins into the inferior vena cava.\\nNormal portal pressure is 5 to 10 mm Hg (7 to 14 cm H2O), which exceeds inferior vena caval pressure\\nby 4 to 5 mm Hg (portal venous gradient). Higher values are defined as portal hypertension.\\nEtiology\\nPortal hypertension results mainly from increased resistance to flow, which commonly arises from disease\\nwithin the liver itself or uncommonly from blockage of the splenic or portal vein or impaired hepatic\\nvenous outflow (see\\nTable 23-7). Increased flow volume is a rare cause, although it often contributes to portal hypertension in\\ncirrhosis and in hematologic disorders that cause massive splenomegaly.\\nPathophysiology\\nIn cirrhosis, tissue fibrosis and regeneration increase resistance in the sinusoids and terminal portal\\nvenules. However, other potentially reversible factors contribute; they include contractility of sinusoidal\\nlining cells, production of vasoactive substances (eg, endothelins, nitric oxide), various systemic\\nmediators of arteriolar resistance, and possibly swelling of hepatocytes.\\nOver time, portal hypertension creates portal-systemic venous collaterals. They may slightly decrease\\nportal vein pressure but can cause complications. Engorged serpentine submucosal vessels (varices) in\\nthe distal esophagus and sometimes in the gastric fundus can rupture, causing sudden, catastrophic GI', \"bleeding. Bleeding rarely occurs unless the portal pressure gradient is > 12 mm Hg. Gastric mucosal\\nvascular congestion (portal hypertensive gastropathy) can cause acute or chronic bleeding independent\\nof varices. Visible abdominal wall collaterals are common; veins radiating from the umbilicus (caput\\nmedusae) are much rarer and indicate extensive flow in the umbilical and periumbilical veins.\\n[Table 23-7. Most Common Causes of Portal Hypertension]\\nCollaterals around the rectum can cause rectal varices that can bleed.\\nPortal-systemic collaterals shunt blood away from the liver. Thus, less blood reaches the liver when portal\\nflow increases (diminished hepatic reserve). In addition, toxic substances from the intestine are shunted\\ndirectly to the systemic circulation, contributing to portal-systemic encephalopathy (see p. 220). Venous\\ncongestion within visceral organs due to portal hypertension contributes to ascites via altered Starling's\\nforces. Splenomegaly and hypersplenism (see p. 984) commonly occur as a result of increased splenic\\nvein pressure. Thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and, less commonly, hemolytic anemia may result.\\nPortal hypertension is often associated with a hyperdynamic circulation. Mechanisms are complex and\\nseem to involve altered sympathetic tone, production of nitric oxide and other endogenous vasodilators,\\nand enhanced activity of humoral factors (eg, glucagon).\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nPortal hypertension is asymptomatic; symptoms and signs result from its complications.

Prognosis is predicted by the degree of\\nhepatic reserve and the degree of bleeding. For survivors, the bleeding risk within the next 1 to 2 yr is 50\\nto 75%.

Encephalopathy also follows portal-systemic\\nanastomoses, such as surgically created anastomoses connecting the portal vein and vena cava\\n(portacaval shunts, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting [TIPS]).\\nPrecipitants: In patients with chronic liver disease, acute episodes of encephalopathy are usually\\nprecipitated by reversible causes. The most common are the following:\\n• Metabolic stress (eg, infection; electrolyte imbalance, especially hypokalemia; dehydration; use of\\ndiuretic drugs)\\n• Disorders that increase gut protein (eg, GI bleeding, high-protein diet)\\n• Nonspecific cerebral depressants (eg, alcohol, sedatives, analgesics)\\nPathophysiology\\nIn portal-systemic shunting, absorbed products that would otherwise be detoxified by the liver enter the\\nsystemic circulation, where they may be toxic to the brain, particularly the cerebral cortex. The\\nsubstances causing brain toxicity are not precisely known. Ammonia, a product of protein digestion, is an\\nimportant cause, but other factors (eg, alterations in cerebral benzodiazepine receptors and\\nneurotransmission by γ-aminobutyric acid [GABA]) may also contribute.

Individual tests, particularly those of liver biochemistry and excretion, often have limited sensitivity\\nand specificity. A combination of tests often best defines the cause and severity of disease. Useful\\nalgorithms (eg, Model of End-Stage Liver Disease [MELD], Child-Pugh score) have incorporated clinical\\nand laboratory features to predict survival in patients with decompensated cirrhosis.\\nLaboratory Tests\\nLaboratory tests are generally effective for the following:\\n• Detecting hepatic dysfunction\\n• Assessing the severity of liver injury\\n• Monitoring the course of liver diseases and the response to treatment\\n• Refining the diagnosis\\nMany tests of liver biochemistry and excretory performance are called liver function tests. However, rather\\nthan assessing liver function, several of these tests measure liver enzymes that are released into the\\nbloodstream (eg, release of aminotransferases from injured liver cells or of alkaline phosphatase due to\\ncholestasis). Only certain tests actually assess liver function by evaluating hepatobiliary excretion (eg,\\nbilirubin) or the liver's synthetic capability (eg, PT, usually reported as the INR; albumin).\\nThe most useful laboratory tests to screen for liver disorders are serum aminotransferases (the most\\ncommonly used liver function tests), bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase. Certain patterns of biochemical\\nabnormalities help distinguish hepatocellular injury from impaired bile excretion (cholestasis—see\\nTable 24-1). Tests that detect viral hepatitis, liver inflammation, or altered immunoregulation include\\nhepatitis serologic tests (see p. 251) and measurement of immunoglobulins, antibodies, and\\nautoantibodies.\\nA few laboratory tests are diagnostic by themselves; they include the following:\\n• IgM antibody to hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) for acute hepatitis A\\n• Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) for hepatitis B\\n• Antibody to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) and HCV-RNA for hepatitis C\\n• Antimitochondrial antibody for primary biliary cirrhosis\", \"• Antimitochondrial antibody for primary biliary cirrhosis\\n• Serum ceruloplasmin (reduced) and urinary copper (elevated) for Wilson's disease\\n• Serum α1-antitrypsin for α1-antitrypsin deficiency\\n• α-Fetoprotein for hepatocellular carcinoma\\nTests for Liver Injury\\nAminotransferases: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) leak from\\ndamaged cells; thus, these enzymes are sensitive indicators of liver injury.

However, in alcohol-related liver disease, the ratio is\\ncharacteristically > 2 because pyridoxal-5´-phosphate is deficient in alcoholic patients; it is required for\\nALT synthesis but is less essential for AST synthesis.

Bilirubin\\nis conjugated in the liver with glucuronic acid to form the more water-soluble bilirubin diglucuronide.\\nConjugated bilirubin is then excreted through the biliary tract into the duodenum, where it is metabolized\\ninto urobilinogens (some of which are reabsorbed and resecreted into bile), then into orange-colored\\nurobilins (most of which are eliminated in feces).

Sometimes alterations increase levels of bioavailable drug, causing normal drug doses to have\\ntoxic effects. However, levels and effects for an individual drug are unpredictable and do not correlate\\nwell with the type of liver injury, its severity, or liver function test results.

Fibrosis and Cirrhosis\\nIntroduction\\nIn hepatic fibrosis, excessive connective tissue accumulates in the liver; this tissue represents scarring in\\nresponse to chronic, repeated liver cell injury. Commonly, fibrosis progresses, disrupting hepatic\\narchitecture and eventually function, as regenerating hepatocytes attempt to replace and repair damaged\\ntissue. When such disruption is widespread, cirrhosis is diagnosed. To develop, cirrhosis usually requires\\n> 6 mo of liver disease but can occur more rapidly (eg, during infancy with biliary atresia, after liver\\ntransplantation for severe liver disease secondary to chronic hepatitis B or C).\\nFibrosis\\nHepatic fibrosis is overly exuberant wound healing in which excessive connective tissue builds\\nup in the liver. The extracellular matrix is overproduced, degraded deficiently, or both. The\\ntrigger is chronic injury, especially if there is an inflammatory component. Fibrosis itself causes\\nno symptoms but can lead to portal hypertension (the scarring distorts blood flow through the\\nliver) or cirrhosis (the scarring results in disruption of normal hepatic architecture and liver\\ndysfunction). Diagnosis is based on liver biopsy. Treatment involves correcting the underlying\\ncondition when possible.\\nVarious types of chronic liver injury can cause fibrosis (see\\nTable 27-1). Self-limited, acute liver injury (eg, acute viral hepatitis A), even when fulminant, does not\\nnecessarily distort the scaffolding architecture and hence does not cause fibrosis, despite loss of\\nhepatocytes. In its initial stages, hepatic fibrosis can regress if the cause is reversible (eg, with viral\\nclearance). After months or years of chronic or repeated injury, fibrosis becomes permanent. Fibrosis\\ndevelops even more rapidly in mechanical biliary obstruction.\\nPathophysiology\\nActivation of the hepatic perivascular stellate cells (Ito cells, which store fat) initiates fibrosis. These and\\nadjacent cells proliferate, becoming contractile cells termed myofibroblasts. These cells produce\\nexcessive amounts of abnormal matrix (consisting of collagen, other glycoproteins, and glycans) and', 'matricellular proteins. Kupffer cells (resident macrophages), injured hepatocytes, platelets, and\\nleukocytes aggregate. As a result, reactive O2 species and inflammatory mediators (eg, platelet-derived\\ngrowth factor, transforming growth factors, and connective tissue growth factor) are released. Thus,\\nstellate cell activation results in abnormal extracellular matrix, both in quantity and composition.\\nMyofibroblasts, stimulated by endothelin-1, contribute to increased portal vein resistance and increase\\nthe density of the abnormal matrix. Fibrous tracts join branches of afferent portal veins and efferent\\nhepatic veins, bypassing the hepatocytes and limiting their blood supply. Hence, fibrosis contributes both\\nto hepatocyte ischemia (causing hepatocellular dysfunction) and portal hypertension. The\\n[Table 27-1. Disorders and Drugs that Can Cause Hepatic Fibrosis]\\nextent of the ischemia and portal hypertension determines how the liver is affected. For example,\\ncongenital hepatic fibrosis affects portal vein branches, largely sparing the parenchyma. The result is\\nportal hypertension with sparing of hepatocellular function.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nHepatic fibrosis itself does not cause symptoms. Symptoms may develop secondary to the primary\\ndisorder or to portal hypertension. Portal hypertension with splenomegaly is often asymptomatic unless\\ncomplications, such as variceal GI bleeding, ascites, or portal-systemic encephalopathy, develop.\\nEventually, cirrhosis supervenes.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition\\nChapter 27.

Noninvasive tests (eg,\\nserologic markers) are under study but are not yet ready for routine clinical use. Imaging tests such as\\nultrasonography, CT, and MRI may detect findings associated with fibrosis (eg, portal hypertension,\\nsplenomegaly, cirrhosis) but are not sensitive to parenchymal fibrosis itself. Liver biopsy is currently the\\nonly means of detecting hepatic fibrosis. Biopsy is indicated to clarify the diagnosis (eg, nonalcoholic\\nsteatohepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis) and stage its progress (eg, in chronic hepatitis C to determine\\nwhether fibrosis is present or whether it has progressed to cirrhosis).\\nTreatment\\n• Treatment of cause\\nBecause fibrosis represents a response to hepatic damage, primary treatment should focus on the cause\\n(removing the basis of the liver injury). Such treatment may include eliminating HBC or HCV in chronic\\nviral hepatitis, abstaining from alcohol in alcoholic liver disease, removing heavy metals such as iron in\\nhemochromatosis or copper in Wilson's disease, and decompressing bile ducts in biliary obstruction.\\nTreatments aimed at reversing the fibrosis are usually too toxic for long-term use (eg, corticosteroids,\\npenicillamine) or have no proven efficacy (eg, colchicine). Other antifibrotic treatments are under study.\\nSimultaneous use of multiple antifibrotic drugs may eventually prove most beneficial.\\nCirrhosis\\nCirrhosis is a late stage of hepatic fibrosis that has resulted in widespread distortion of normal\\nhepatic architecture. Cirrhosis is characterized by regenerative nodules surrounded by dense\\nfibrotic tissue. Symptoms may not develop for years and are often nonspecific (eg, anorexia,\\nfatigue, weight loss). Late manifestations include portal hypertension, ascites, and, when\\ndecompensation occurs, liver failure. Diagnosis often requires liver biopsy. Cirrhosis is usually\\nconsidered irreversible. Treatment is supportive.\", 'considered irreversible. Treatment is supportive.\\nCirrhosis is a leading cause of death worldwide. The causes of cirrhosis are the same as those of fibrosis\\n(see Table 27-1). In developed countries, most cases result from chronic alcohol abuse or chronic\\nhepatitis C. In parts of Asia and Africa, cirrhosis often results from chronic hepatitis B. Cirrhosis of\\nunknown etiology (cryptogenic cirrhosis) is becoming less common as many specific causes (eg, chronic\\nhepatitis C, steatohepatitis) are identified. Injury to the bile ducts also can result in cirrhosis, as occurs in\\nmechanical bile duct obstruction, primary biliary cirrhosis (see p. 244), and primary sclerosing cholangitis\\n(see p. 278).\\nPathophysiology\\nThere are 2 primary factors:\\n• Hepatic fibrosis\\n• Regenerating liver cells\\nIn response to injury and loss, growth regulators induce hepatocellular hyperplasia (producing\\nregenerating nodules) and arterial growth (angiogenesis).

Such interconnecting vessels provide relatively low-volume, high-pressure venous drainage\\nthat cannot accommodate as much blood volume as normal. As a result, portal vein pressure increases.\\nSuch distortions in blood flow contribute to portal hypertension, which increases because the\\nregenerating nodules compress hepatic venules.\\nThe progression rate from fibrosis to cirrhosis and the morphology of cirrhosis vary from person to\\nperson. Presumably, the reason for such variation is the extent of exposure to the injurious stimulus and\\nthe individual's response.\\nComplications: Portal hypertension (see p. 218) is the most common serious complication; it can\\nmanifest as GI bleeding from esophageal, gastric, or rectal varices or portal hypertensive gastropathy.\\nPortal hypertension can be massive. Cirrhosis can cause other cardiovascular complications. Vasodilation\\nand intrapulmonary right-to-left shunting and ventilation/perfusion mismatch can result in hypoxia\\n(hepatopulmonary syndrome). A cardiac myopathy can also accompany cirrhosis.\\nAscites can develop, with a risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Splenic congestion with\\nhypersplenism may occur, resulting in splenomegaly, platelet sequestration, and consequent cytopenia.\\nProgressive loss of hepatic architecture impairs function, leading to hepatic insufficiency; it manifests as\\ncoagulopathy, renal failure (hepatorenal syndrome—see p. 223), and hepatic encephalopathy.\\nHepatocytes secrete less bile, contributing to cholestasis and jaundice. Less bile in the intestine causes\\nmalabsorption of dietary fat (triglycerides) and fat-soluble vitamins. Malabsorption of vitamin D may\\ncontribute to osteoporosis. Undernutrition is common. It may result from anorexia with reduced food intake\\nor, in patients with alcoholic liver disease, from malabsorption due to pancreatic insufficiency.\\nBlood disorders are common. Anemia results from hypersplenism, chronic GI bleeding, folate deficiency\", '(particularly in patients with alcoholism), and hemolysis. Clotting may be impaired because of\\ncoagulopathy or thrombocytopenia. Coagulopathy results from impaired hepatic synthesis of the factors\\nnecessary for clotting, malabsorption of vitamin K due to impaired bile secretion into the duodenum, or\\nboth. Thrombocytopenia may be caused by hypersplenism (platelet sequestration), alcohol excess\\n(directly inhibiting the bone marrow), or both. Pancytopenia also occurs with alcoholism.\\nHepatocellular carcinoma frequently complicates cirrhosis, particularly cirrhosis resulting from chronic\\nhepatitis B and C viruses, hemochromatosis, alcohol-related liver disease, α1antitrypsin deficiency, or\\nglycogen storage disease.\\nHistopathology: Cirrhosis is characterized by regenerating nodules and fibrosis. Incompletely formed\\nliver nodules, nodules without fibrosis (nodular regenerative hyperplasia), and congenital hepatic fibrosis\\n(ie, widespread fibrosis without regenerating nodules) are not true cirrhosis.\\nCirrhosis can be micronodular or macronodular. Micronodular cirrhosis is characterized by uniformly small\\nnodules (< 3 mm in diameter) and thick regular bands of connective tissue. Typically, nodules lack lobular\\norganization; terminal (central) hepatic venules and portal triads are distorted. With time, macronodular\\ncirrhosis often develops. The nodules vary in size (3 mm to 5 cm in diameter) and have some rather\\nnormal lobular organization of portal triads and terminal hepatic venules. Broad fibrous bands of varying\\nthickness surround the large nodules. Collapse of the normal hepatic architecture is suggested by the\\nconcentration of portal triads within the fibrous scars.

Most (95%) cases\\noccur in women aged 35 to 70. PBC also clusters in families. A genetic predisposition, perhaps involving\\nthe X chromosome, probably contributes. There may be an inherited abnormality of immune regulation. An\\nautoimmune mechanism has been implicated; antibodies to antigens located on the inner mitochondrial\\nmembranes occur in > 95% of cases. These antimitochondrial antibodies (AMAs), the serologic hallmarks\\nof PBC, are not cytotoxic and are not involved in bile duct damage. PBC is associated with other\\nautoimmune disorders, such as RA, systemic sclerosis, Sjogren's syndrome, CREST syndrome,\\nautoimmune thyroiditis, and renal tubular acidosis.\\nT cells attack the small bile ducts. CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes directly target biliary epithelial cells. The\\ntrigger for the immunologic attack on bile ducts is unknown. Exposure to foreign antigens, such as an\\ninfectious (bacterial or viral) or toxic agent, may be the instigating event. These foreign antigens might be\\nstructurally similar to endogenous proteins (molecular mimicry); then the subsequent immunologic\\nreaction would be autoimmune and self-perpetuating. Destruction and loss of bile ducts lead to impaired\\nbile formation and secretion (cholestasis). Retained toxic materials such as bile acids then cause further\\ndamage, particularly to hepatocytes. Chronic cholestasis thus leads to liver cell inflammation and scarring\\nin the periportal areas.

Hepatitis\\nIntroduction\\nHepatitis is an inflammation of the liver characterized by diffuse or patchy necrosis. Major causes are\\nspecific hepatitis viruses, alcohol, and drugs. Less common causes include other viral infections (eg,\\ninfectious mononucleosis, yellow fever, cytomegalovirus infection) and leptospirosis. Parasitic infections\\n(eg, schistosomiasis, malaria, amebiasis), pyogenic infections, and abscesses that affect the liver are not\\nconsidered hepatitis. Liver involvement with TB and other granulomatous infiltrations is sometimes called\\ngranulomatous hepatitis, but the clinical, biochemical, and histologic features differ from those of diffuse\\nhepatitis.\\nVarious systemic infections and other illnesses may produce small focal areas of hepatic inflammation or\\nnecrosis. This nonspecific reactive hepatitis can cause minor liver function abnormalities but is usually\\nasymptomatic.\\nSome types of infectious and noninfectious liver inflammation are summarized (see\\nTable 28-1).\\nAcute Viral Hepatitis\\nAcute viral hepatitis is diffuse liver inflammation caused by specific hepatotropic viruses that\\nhave diverse modes of transmission and epidemiologies. A nonspecific viral prodrome is\\nfollowed by anorexia, nausea, and often fever or right upper quadrant pain. Jaundice often\\ndevelops, typically as other symptoms begin to resolve. Most cases resolve spontaneously, but\\nsome progress to chronic hepatitis. Occasionally, acute viral hepatitis progresses to acute\\nhepatic failure (fulminant hepatitis). Diagnosis is by liver function tests and serologic tests to\\nidentify the virus. Good hygiene can prevent acute viral hepatitis. Depending on the specific\\nvirus, preexposure and postexposure prophylaxis may be possible using vaccines or serum\\nglobulins. Treatment is usually supportive.\\n(See also Neonatal Hepatitis B Virus Infection on p. 2825.)\\nAcute viral hepatitis is a common, worldwide disease that has different causes; each type shares clinical,\\nbiochemical, and morphologic features. Liver infections caused by nonhepatitis viruses (eg, Epstein-Barr\\nvirus, yellow fever virus, cytomegalovirus) generally are not termed acute viral hepatitis.\\nEtiology\\nAt least 5 specific viruses appear to be responsible (see\\nTable 28-2). Other unidentified viruses probably also cause acute viral hepatitis.', 'Table 28-2). Other unidentified viruses probably also cause acute viral hepatitis.\\nHepatitis A virus (HAV): HAV is a single-stranded RNA picornavirus. It is the most common cause of\\nacute viral hepatitis and is particularly common among children and young adults. In some countries, >\\n75% of adults have been exposed. HAV spreads primarily by fecal-oral contact and thus may occur in\\nareas of poor hygiene. Waterborne and food-borne epidemics occur, especially in underdeveloped\\ncountries. Eating contaminated raw shellfish is sometimes responsible. Sporadic cases are also common,\\nusually as a result of person-to-person contact. Fecal shedding of the virus occurs before symptoms\\ndevelop and usually ceases a few days after symptoms begin; thus, infectivity often has already ceased\\nwhen hepatitis becomes clinically evident. HAV has no known chronic carrier state and does not cause\\nchronic hepatitis or cirrhosis.\\nHepatitis B virus (HBV): HBV is the most thoroughly characterized and complex hepatitis virus. The\\ninfective particle consists of a viral core plus an outer surface coat. The core contains circular double-\\nstranded DNA and DNA polymerase, and it replicates within the nuclei of infected hepatocytes. A surface\\ncoat is added in the cytoplasm and, for unknown reasons, is produced in great excess.\\nHBV is the 2nd most common cause of acute viral hepatitis. Prior unrecognized infection is common but is\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition\\nChapter 28.

HBV is often transmitted parenterally, typically by contaminated\\nblood or blood products. Routine screening of donor blood for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) has\\nnearly eliminated the previously common posttransfusion transmission, but transmission through needles\\nshared by drug users remains common. Risk of HBV is increased for patients in renal dialysis and\\noncology units and for hospital personnel in contact with blood. The virus may be spread through contact\\nwith other body fluids (eg, between sex partners, both heterosexual and homosexual; in closed\\ninstitutions, such as mental health institutions and prisons), but infectivity is far lower than that of HAV,\\nand the means of transmission is often unknown. The role of insect bites in transmission is unclear. Many\\ncases of acute hepatitis B occur sporadically without a known source.\\nHBV, for unknown reasons, is sometimes associated with several primarily extrahepatic disorders,\\nincluding polyarteritis nodosa, other connective tissue diseases, membranous glomerulonephritis, and\\nessential mixed cryoglobulinemia. The pathogenic role of HBV in these disorders is unclear, but\\nautoimmune mechanisms are suggested.\\nChronic HBV carriers provide a worldwide reservoir of infection. Prevalence varies widely according to\\nseveral factors, including geography (eg, < 0.5% in North America and northern Europe, > 10% in some\\nregions of the Far East). Vertical transmission from mother to infant is common (see p. 2644).\\n[Table 28-1. Selected Diseases or Organisms Associated with Liver Inflammation]\\nHepatitis C virus (HCV): HCV is a single-stranded RNA flavivirus. Six major HCV subtypes exist with\\nvarying amino acid sequences (genotypes); these subtypes vary geographically and in virulence and\\nresponse to therapy. HCV can also alter its amino acid pattern over time in an infected person, producing\\nquasispecies.\\nInfection is most commonly transmitted through blood, primarily when parenteral drug users share\\nneedles, but also through tattoos or body piercing. Sexual transmission and vertical transmission from\\nmother to infant are relatively rare. Transmission through blood transfusion has become very rare since\\nthe advent of screening tests for donated blood. Some sporadic cases occur in patients without apparent', 'the advent of screening tests for donated blood. Some sporadic cases occur in patients without apparent\\nrisk factors. HCV prevalence varies with geography and other risk factors.\\nHCV infection sometimes occurs simultaneously with specific systemic disorders, including essential\\nmixed cryoglobulinemia, porphyria cutanea tarda (about 60 to 80% of porphyria patients have HCV\\ninfection, but only a few patients infected with HCV develop porphyria), and glomerulonephritis; the\\nmechanisms are uncertain. In addition, up to 20% of patients with alcoholic liver disease harbor HCV. The\\nreasons for this high association are unclear because concomitant alcohol and drug use accounts for only\\na portion of cases. In these patients, HCV and alcohol act synergistically to exacerbate liver damage.\\nHepatitis D virus (HDV): HDV, or delta agent, is a defective RNA virus that can replicate only in the\\npresence of HBV. It occurs uncommonly as a co-infection with acute hepatitis B or as a superinfection in\\nchronic hepatitis B. Infected hepatocytes contain delta particles coated with HBsAg. Prevalence of HDV\\nvaries widely geographically, with endemic pockets in several countries. Parenteral drug users are at\\nrelatively high risk, but HDV (unlike HBV) has not widely permeated the homosexual community.\\nHepatitis E virus (HEV): HEV is an enterically transmitted RNA virus. Outbreaks of acute HEV infection,\\noften waterborne and linked to fecal contamination of the water supply, have occurred in China, India,\\nMexico, Pakistan, Peru, Russia, and central and northern Africa. These outbreaks have epidemiologic\\ncharacteristics similar to HAV epidemics. Sporadic cases also occur. No outbreaks have occurred in the\\nUS or in Western Europe. Like HAV, HEV does not cause chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis, and there is no\\nchronic carrier state.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nGeneral: Acute infection tends to develop in predictable phases. Infection begins with an incubation\\nperiod (see Table 28-2), during which the virus multiplies and spreads without symptoms.

Hyperbilirubinemia in\\nacute viral hepatitis varies in severity, and fractionation has no clinical value. Alkaline phosphatase is\\nusually only moderately elevated; marked elevation suggests extrahepatic cholestasis and prompts\\nimaging tests (eg, ultrasonography). Liver biopsy generally is not needed unless the diagnosis is\\nuncertain. If laboratory results suggest acute hepatitis, particularly if ALT and AST are > 1000 IU/L, PT is\\nmeasured.

A history of exposure\\nmay provide the only clue of drug-induced or toxic hepatitis. The history should also elicit risk factors for\\nviral hepatitis. Prodromal sore throat and diffuse adenopathy suggest infectious mononucleosis rather\\nthan viral hepatitis. Alcoholic hepatitis is suggested by a history of drinking, more gradual onset of\\nsymptoms, and presence of vascular spiders or signs of chronic alcohol use or chronic liver disease (see\\nalso p. 235); aminotransferase levels rarely exceed 300 IU/L, even in severe cases.

Its presence with anti-HBs indicates recovery from\\nprevious HBV infection. Anti-HBc is also present in chronic HBsAg carriers, who do not mount an anti-HBs\\nresponse. In acute infection, anti-HBc is mainly of the IgM class, whereas in chronic infection, IgG anti-\\nHBc predominates. IgM anti-HBc is a sensitive marker of acute HBV infection and occasionally is the only\\nmarker of recent infection, reflecting a window between disappearance of HBsAg and appearance of\\nanti-HBs.\\nHBeAg is a protein derived from the viral core (not to be confused with hepatitis E virus).\\n[Table 28-3. Hepatitis A Serology]\\nPresent only in HBsAg-positive serum, HBeAg tends to suggest more active viral replication and greater\\ninfectivity. In contrast, presence of the corresponding antibody (anti-HBe) suggests lower infectivity. Thus,\\ne antigen markers are more helpful in prognosis than in diagnosis. Chronic liver disease develops more\\noften among patients with HBeAg and less often among patients with anti-HBe.\\nIn patients with active HBV infection, HBV-DNA can be detected in the serum with special testing,\\nalthough this testing is not routinely available.\\nIn HCV, serum antibody to HCV (anti-HCV) almost always implies active infection; it is not protective. Anti-\\nHCV usually appears within 2 wk of acute infection but is sometimes delayed; however, HCV-RNA is\\npositive. In a small proportion of patients, anti-HCV merely reflects prior exposure with clearance of the\\nvirus rather than active infection. In such cases, ALT and AST levels are usually normal. In unclear cases,\\nHCV-RNA is measured.\\n[Table 28-4. Hepatitis B Serology*]\\n[Table 28-5. Hepatitis C Serology]\\nIn HDV, anti-HDV implies active infection. It may not be detectable until weeks after the acute illness.', 'In HEV, the test for IgM anti-HEV is not routinely available. In a patient with endemic exposure and\\ncompatible clinical findings, anti-HEV suggests acute HEV infection.\\nBiopsy: Biopsy is usually unnecessary but, if done, usually reveals similar histopathology regardless of\\nthe specific virus: patchy cell dropout, acidophilic hepatocellular necrosis, mononuclear inflammatory\\ninfiltrate, histologic evidence of regeneration, and preservation of the reticulin framework. HBV can\\noccasionally be diagnosed based on the presence of ground-glass hepatocytes (caused by HBsAg-\\npacked cytoplasm) and using special immunologic stains for the viral components. However, these\\nfindings are unusual in acute HBV and are much more common in chronic HBV infection. HCV causation\\ncan sometimes be inferred from subtle morphologic clues.

Uncommonly, aneurysms develop.\\nHepatic Artery Occlusion\\nCauses of hepatic artery occlusion include thrombosis (eg, due to hypercoagulability disorders, severe\\narteriosclerosis, or vasculitis), emboli (eg, due to endocarditis, tumors, therapeutic embolization, or\\nchemoembolization), iatrogenic causes (eg, ligation during surgery), vasculitis (via nonthrombotic\\nmechanisms), structural arterial abnormalities (eg, hepatic artery aneurysm), eclampsia, cocaine use, and\\nsickle cell crisis. Usually, the result is an hepatic infarct. In patients with a liver transplant or preexisting\\nportal vein thrombosis, hepatic artery thrombosis causes ischemic hepatitis (see p. 259). Because of the', \"liver's dual blood supply, the liver is somewhat resistant to ischemic hepatitis and infarction.\\nHepatic artery occlusion does not elicit symptoms without hepatic infarction or ischemic hepatitis. Hepatic\\ninfarction may be asymptomatic or cause right upper quadrant pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, and\\njaundice. Leukocytosis and a high aminotransferase level are common.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Vascular imaging\\nDiagnosis of hepatic artery occlusion is confirmed by imaging with Doppler ultrasonography, usually\\nfollowed by angiography.

CT may detect a wedge-shaped area\\nof low attenuation.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment is directed at the cause.\\nAneurysms\\nAneurysms of the hepatic artery are uncommon. They tend to be saccular and multiple. Causes include\\ninfection, arteriosclerosis, trauma, and vasculitis.

Gallbladder and Bile Duct Disorders\\nIntroduction\\nThe liver produces about 500 to 600 mL of bile each day. Bile is isosmotic with plasma and consists\\nprimarily of water and electrolytes but also organic compounds: bile salts, phospholipids (mostly lecithin),\\ncholesterol, bilirubin, and other endogenously produced or ingested compounds, such as proteins that\\nregulate GI function and drugs or their metabolites. Bilirubin is a degradation product of heme compounds\\nfrom worn-out RBCs and is the pigment that gives bile its yellow-green color.\\nBile salts (bile acids) are the major organic component in bile. The liver uses active transport to secrete\\nbile salts into the canaliculus, the cleft between adjacent hepatocytes. Canalicular transport is the rate-\\nlimiting step in bile formation. Once secreted, bile salts draw other bile components (particularly Na+ and\\nwater) into the canaliculus by osmosis. Bile salts are also biologic detergents that enable the body to\\nexcrete cholesterol and potentially toxic compounds (eg, bilirubin, drug metabolites). The function of bile\\nsalts in the duodenum is to solubilize ingested fat and fat-soluble vitamins, facilitating their digestion and\\nabsorption. From the liver, bile flows from the intrahepatic collecting system into the right or left hepatic\\nduct, then into the common hepatic duct.\\nDuring fasting, about 75% of the bile secreted passes from the common hepatic duct into the gallbladder\\nvia the cystic duct. The rest flows directly into the common bile duct (formed by the junction of the\\ncommon hepatic and cystic ducts) into the duodenum. During fasting, the gallbladder absorbs up to 90%\\nof bile water, concentrating and storing bile.\\nBile empties from the gallbladder into the common bile duct. The common bile duct joins with the\\npancreatic duct to form the ampulla of Vater, which empties into the duodenum. Before joining the\\npancreatic duct, the common bile duct tapers to a diameter of ≤ 0.6 cm.', 'The sphincter of Oddi, which surrounds both the pancreatic duct and the common bile duct, includes a\\nsphincter for each duct. Bile does not normally flow retrograde into the pancreatic duct. These sphincters\\nare highly sensitive to cholecystokinin and other gut hormones (eg, gastrin-releasing peptide) and to\\nalterations in cholinergic tone (eg, by anticholinergic drugs).\\nEating releases gut hormones and stimulates cholinergic nerves, causing the gallbladder to contract and\\nthe sphincter of Oddi to relax. As a result, the gallbladder empties 50 to 75% of its contents into the\\nduodenum. Conversely, during fasting, an increase in sphincter tone facilitates gallbladder filling.\\nBile salts are poorly absorbed by passive diffusion in the proximal small bowel; most intestinal bile salts\\nreach the terminal ileum, which actively absorbs 90% into the portal venous circulation. Returned to the\\nliver, bile salts are efficiently extracted, promptly modified (eg, conjugated if they arrive in the free form),\\nand secreted back into bile. Bile salts circulate through this pathway from liver to gut to liver—the\\nenterohepatic circulation—10 to 12 times/day.\\nCholelithiasis\\nCholelithiasis is the presence of one or more calculi (gallstones) in the gallbladder. In\\ndeveloped countries, about 10% of adults and 20% of people > 65 yr have gallstones. Gallstones\\ntend to be asymptomatic. The most common symptom is biliary colic; gallstones do not cause\\ndyspepsia or fatty food intolerance. More serious complications include cholecystitis; biliary\\ntract obstruction (from stones in the bile ducts or choledocholithiasis), sometimes with infection\\n(cholangitis); and gallstone pancreatitis. Diagnosis is usually by ultrasonography. If\\ncholelithiasis causes symptoms or complications, cholecystectomy is necessary.\\nRisk factors for gallstones include female sex, obesity, increased age, American Indian ethnicity, a\\nWestern diet, and a family history. Most disorders of the biliary tract result from gallstones.\\nPathophysiology', 'Pathophysiology\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition\\nChapter 31.

It consists of Ca bilirubinate (a polymer of bilirubin),\\ncholesterol microcrystals, and mucin. Sludge develops during gallbladder stasis, as occurs during\\npregnancy or use of TPN. Most sludge is asymptomatic and disappears when the primary condition\\nresolves. Alternatively, sludge can evolve into gallstones or migrate into the biliary tract, obstructing the\\nducts and leading to biliary colic, cholangitis, or pancreatitis.\\nThere are several types of gallstones.\\nCholesterol stones account for > 85% of gallstones in the Western world. For cholesterol gallstones to\\nform, the following is required:\\n• Bile must be supersaturated with cholesterol. Normally, water-insoluble cholesterol is made water\\nsoluble by combining with bile salts and lecithin to form mixed micelles. Supersaturation of bile with\\ncholesterol most commonly results from excessive cholesterol secretion (as occurs in obesity or\\ndiabetes) but may result from a decrease in bile salt secretion (eg, in cystic fibrosis because of bile salt\\nmalabsorption) or in lecithin secretion (eg, in a rare genetic disorder that causes a form of progressive\\nintrahepatic familial cholestasis).\\n• The excess cholesterol must precipitate from solution as solid microcrystals. Such precipitation in the\\ngallbladder is accelerated by mucin, a glycoprotein, or other proteins in bile.\\n• The microcrystals must aggregate and grow. This process is facilitated by the binding effect of mucin\\nforming a scaffold and by retention of microcrystals in the gallbladder with impaired contractility due to\\nexcess cholesterol in bile.\\nBlack pigment stones are small, hard gallstones composed of Ca bilirubinate and inorganic Ca salts\\n(eg, Ca carbonate, Ca phosphate). Factors that accelerate stone development include alcoholic liver\\ndisease, chronic hemolysis, and older age.\\nBrown pigment stones are soft and greasy, consisting of bilirubinate and fatty acids (Ca palmitate or', 'stearate). They form during infection, inflammation, and parasitic infestation (eg, liver flukes in Asia).\\nGallstones grow at about 1 to 2 mm/yr, taking 5 to 20 yr before becoming large enough to cause\\nproblems. Most gallstones form within the gallbladder, but brown pigment stones form in the ducts.\\nGallstones may migrate to the bile duct after cholecystectomy or, particularly in the case of brown pigment\\nstones, develop behind strictures as a result of stasis and infection.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nAbout 80% of people with gallstones are asymptomatic. The remainder have symptoms ranging from\\nbiliary-type pain (biliary colic) to cholecystitis to life-threatening cholangitis. Biliary colic is the most\\ncommon symptom.\\nStones occasionally traverse the cystic duct without causing symptoms. However, most gallstone\\nmigration leads to cystic duct obstruction, which, even if transient, causes biliary colic. Biliary colic\\ncharacteristically begins in the right upper quadrant but may occur elsewhere in the abdomen. It is often\\npoorly localized, particularly in diabetics and the elderly. The pain may radiate into the back or down the\\narm. Episodes begin suddenly, become intense within 15 min to 1 h, remain at a steady intensity (not\\ncolicky) for up to 12 h (usually < 6 h), and then gradually disappear over 30 to 90 min, leaving a dull ache.\\nThe pain is usually severe enough to send patients to the emergency department for relief.

Abdominal ultrasonography is the method of choice\\nfor detecting gallbladder stones; sensitivity and specificity are 95%. Ultrasonography also accurately\\ndetects sludge. CT, MRI (see p. 230), and oral cholecystography (rarely available now, although quite\\naccurate) are alternatives.

Laboratory tests usually are not helpful; typically, results are\\nnormal unless complications develop. Asymptomatic gallstones and biliary sludge are often detected\\nincidentally when imaging, usually ultrasonography, is done for other reasons. About 10 to 15% of\\ngallstones are calcified and visible on plain x-rays.\\nPrognosis\\nPatients with asymptomatic gallstones become symptomatic at a rate of about 2%/yr. The symptom that\\ndevelops most commonly is biliary colic rather than a major biliary complication. Once biliary symptoms\\nbegin, they are likely to recur; pain returns in 20 to 40% of patients/yr, and about 1 to 2% of patients/yr\\ndevelop complications such as cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, cholangitis, and gallstone pancreatitis.\\nTreatment\\n• Laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic stones\\n• Expectant for asymptomatic stones; sometimes stone dissolution\\nMost asymptomatic patients decide that the discomfort, expense, and risk of elective surgery are not\\nworth removing an organ that may never cause clinical illness. However, if symptoms occur, gallbladder\\nremoval (cholecystectomy) is indicated because pain is likely to recur and serious complications can\\ndevelop.', 'develop.\\nSurgery: Surgery can be done with an open or laparoscopic technique.\\nOpen cholecystectomy, which involves a large abdominal incision and direct exploration, is safe and\\neffective. Its overall mortality rate is about 0.1% when done electively during a period free of\\ncomplications.\\nLaparoscopic cholecystectomy is the treatment of choice. Using video endoscopy and instrumentation\\nthrough small abdominal incisions, the procedure is less invasive than open cholecystectomy. The result\\nis a much shorter convalescence, decreased postoperative discomfort, improved cosmetic results, yet no\\nincrease in morbidity or mortality. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is converted to an open procedure in 2\\nto 5% of patients, usually because biliary anatomy cannot be identified or a complication cannot be\\nmanaged. Older age typically increases the risks of any type of surgery.\\nCholecystectomy effectively prevents future biliary colic but is less effective for preventing atypical\\nsymptoms such as dyspepsia. Cholecystectomy does not result in nutritional problems or a need for\\ndietary limitations. Some patients develop diarrhea, often because bile salt malabsorption in the ileum is\\nunmasked. Prophylactic cholecystectomy is warranted in asymptomatic patients with cholelithiasis only if\\nthey have large gallstones (> 3 cm) or a calcified gallbladder (porcelain gallbladder); these conditions\\nincrease the risk of gallbladder carcinoma.\\nStone dissolution: For patients who decline surgery or who are at high surgical risk (eg, because of\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition\\nChapter 31.

Symptoms include right upper quadrant pain and\\ntenderness, sometimes accompanied by fever, chills, nausea, and vomiting. Abdominal\\nultrasonography detects the gallstone and sometimes the associated inflammation. Treatment\\nusually involves antibiotics and cholecystectomy.\\nAcute cholecystitis is the most common complication of cholelithiasis. Conversely, ≥ 95% of patients with\\nacute cholecystitis have cholelithiasis. When a stone becomes impacted in the cystic duct and\\npersistently obstructs it, acute inflammation results. Bile stasis triggers release of inflammatory enzymes\\n(eg, phospholipase A, which converts lecithin to lysolecithin, which then may mediate inflammation). The', 'damaged mucosa secretes more fluid into the gallbladder lumen than it absorbs. The resulting distention\\nfurther releases inflammatory mediators (eg, prostaglandins), worsening mucosal damage and causing\\nischemia, all of which perpetuate inflammation. Bacterial infection can supervene. The vicious circle of\\nfluid secretion and inflammation, when unchecked, leads to necrosis and perforation. If acute\\ninflammation resolves, the gallbladder becomes fibrotic and contracted and does not concentrate bile or\\nempty normally—features of chronic cholecystitis.\\nAcute acalculous cholecystitis: Acalculous cholecystitis is cholecystitis without stones. It accounts for\\n5 to 10% of cholecystectomies done for acute cholecystitis. Risk factors include the following:\\n• Critical illness (eg, major surgery, burns, sepsis, or trauma)\\n• Prolonged fasting or TPN (both predispose to bile stasis)\\n• Shock\\n• Immune deficiency\\n• Vasculitis (eg, SLE, polyarteritis nodosa)\\nThe mechanism probably involves inflammatory mediators released because of ischemia, infection, or bile\\nstasis.

Arthritis\\nhas myriad possible causes, including infection, autoimmune disorders, crystal-induced inflammation, and\\nnoninflammatory tissue degeneration (eg, osteoarthritis). Arthritis may affect single joints (monarthritis) or\\nmultiple joints (polyarthritis) in a symmetric or asymmetric manner.

Many\\nsymptoms, including fever, chills, malaise, weight loss, Raynaud's syndrome, mucocutaneous symptoms\\n(eg, rash, eye irritation or pain, photosensitivity), and GI or cardiopulmonary symptoms, can be associated\\nwith various joint disorders.\\nPain is the most common symptom of joint disorders. The history should address the character, location,\\nseverity, factors that aggravate or relieve pain, and time frame (new-onset or recurrent). The clinician\\nmust determine whether pain is worse when first moving a joint or after prolonged use and whether it is\\npresent upon waking or develops during the day. Usually, pain originating from superficial structures is\\nbetter localized than pain originating from deeper structures. Pain originating in small distal joints tends to\\nbe better localized than pain originating in large proximal joints. Joint pain can be referred from extra-\\narticular structures or from other joints. Arthritis often causes aching pain, whereas neuropathies often\\ncause burning pain.\\nStiffness may mean weakness, fatigue, or fixed limitation of motion to patients. The clinician must\\nseparate the inability to move a joint from reluctance to move a joint because of pain. Characteristics of\\nstiffness may suggest a cause, as in the following:\", 'stiffness may suggest a cause, as in the following:\\n• Discomfort that occurs with motion when attempting to move a joint after a period of rest occurs in\\nrheumatic disease.

If chronic RA, gout, or osteoarthritis is suspected, erosions, cysts, and joint space narrowing\\nwith osteophytes may be visible. In pseudogout, Ca pyrophosphate deposition may be visible in intra-\\narticular cartilage.\\nFor musculoskeletal imaging, plain x-rays may be obtained first, but they are often less sensitive,\\nparticularly during early disease, than MRI, CT, or ultrasonography. MRI is the most accurate study for\\nfractures not visible on plain x-rays, particularly in the hip and pelvis, and for soft tissues and internal\\nderangements of the knee. CT is useful if MRI is contraindicated or unavailable. Ultrasonography,\\narthrography, and bone scanning may help in certain conditions, as can biopsy of bone, synovium, or\\nother tissues.\\nArthrocentesis: Arthrocentesis is the process of puncturing the joint with a needle to withdraw fluid. If\\nthere is an effusion and arthrocentesis is done correctly, fluid can generally be withdrawn. Examination of\\nsynovial fluid is the most accurate way to exclude infection, diagnose crystal-induced arthritis, and\\notherwise determine the cause of joint effusions. It is indicated in all patients with severe or unexplained\\nmonarticular joint effusions and in patients with unexplained polyarticular effusions.\\nArthrocentesis is done using strictly sterile technique. Infection or other rash over the site used to enter\\nthe joint is a contraindication. Preparations for collecting samples should be made before doing the\\nprocedure. Local anesthesia, with lidocaine or difluoroethane spray, is often used. Many joints are\\npunctured on the extensor surface to avoid nerves, arteries, and veins, which are usually on the joint's\\nflexor surface. A 20-gauge needle can be used for most larger joints. Smaller joints of the upper and lower\", \"extremities are probably easier to access using a 22- or 23-gage needle. As much fluid as is possible\\nshould be removed. Specific anatomic landmarks are used (see\\nFigs. 32-1,\\n32-2, and\\n32-3).\\nMetacarpophalangeal joints, metatarsophalangeal joints, and interphalangeal joints of the hands and feet\\nare punctured similarly to each other, using a 22- or 23-gauge needle. The needle is inserted dorsally, to\\neither side of the extensor tendon. Distraction of the joint is sometimes useful to open the joint space and\\nallow easier access.\\n[Fig. 32-1. Arthrocentesis of the shoulder.]\\nSynovial fluid examination: At the bedside, gross characteristics of the fluid are assessed, such as its\\ncolor, turbidity, and viscosity. Viscosity can be assessed using the string sign. The length of a viscous\\nstring of joint fluid dropped from the syringe is normally > 3 cm. Inflammation decreases viscosity,\\nshortening the length of the string.\\nGross characteristics allow many effusions to be tentatively classified as noninflammatory, inflammatory,\\nor infectious (see\\nTable 32-2). Effusions can also be hemorrhagic. Each type of effusion suggests certain joint diseases\\n(see\\nTable 32-3). So-called noninflammatory effusions are actually mildly inflammatory but tend to suggest\\ndiseases such as osteoarthritis, in which inflammation is not severe.\\nLaboratory tests commonly done on joint fluid include cell count, leukocyte differential, Gram stain and\\nculture (if infection is a concern—see p. 365), and wet drop examination for cells and crystals. However,\\nthe exact tests often depend on which diagnoses are suspected.\\nMicroscopic examination of a wet drop preparation of synovial fluid for crystals (only a single drop of fluid\\nfrom a joint is needed), using polarized light, is essential for definitive diagnosis of gout, pseudogout, and\\nother crystal-induced arthritides (see p. 349).

RA and the spondyloarthropathies and their variants (see Ch. 35) are also immune mediated.\\nThe triggers and precise pathophysiology remain unknown for all these disorders, although many aspects\\nof pathogenesis are becoming clearer. Patients with most autoimmune rheumatic disorders are at\\nincreased risk of atherosclerosis.\\nEosinophilic Fasciitis\\nEosinophilic fasciitis (EF) is an uncommon disorder characterized by symmetric and painful\\ninflammation, swelling, and induration of the arms and legs. Diagnosis is by biopsy of skin and\\nfascia. Treatment is with corticosteroids.\\nThe cause of EF is unknown. The disorder occurs mostly in middle-aged men but can occur in women\\nand children.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nThe disease often begins after strenuous physical activity (eg, chopping wood). The initial features are\\npain, swelling, and inflammation of the skin and subcutaneous tissues, followed by induration, creating a\\ncharacteristic orange-peel configuration most evident over the anterior surfaces of the extremities. The\\nface and trunk are occasionally involved. Restriction of arm and leg movement usually develops\\ninsidiously. Contractures commonly evolve, secondary to induration and thickening of the fascia, but the\\nprocess may also involve tendons, synovial membranes, and muscle. Typically, EF does not involve the\\nfingers and toes (acral areas). Muscle strength is unimpaired, but myalgia and arthritis may occur. Carpal\\ntunnel syndrome may also occur.\\nFatigue and weight loss are common. Rarely, aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and lymphoproliferative\\nprocesses develop.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Biopsy\\nEF should be suspected in patients with typical symptoms. The cutaneous manifestations may suggest\\nsystemic sclerosis; however, patients with systemic sclerosis usually also have Raynaud's syndrome,\", 'acral involvement, telangiectasia, and visceral changes (eg, esophageal dysmotility). All of these are\\nabsent in EF.\\nDiagnosis is confirmed by en bloc biopsy, which should be deep enough to include fascia and adjacent\\nmuscle fibers. Characteristic findings are inflammation of the fascia, with or without eosinophils.\\nBlood tests are not diagnostic, but CBC shows eosinophilia (in early active disease), and serum protein\\nelectrophoresis shows polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. CBC should be done in all patients because\\nthe presence of eosinophilia helps in the diagnosis. Autoantibodies are usually absent. MRI, although not\\nspecific, can show thickened fascia, the increased signal intensity in the superficial muscle fibers\\ncorrelating with the inflammation.\\nPrognosis\\nAlthough the long-term outcome varies, EF is often self-limited and uncomplicated.\\nTreatment\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition\\nChapter 33.

Hand\\nswelling, Raynaud's syndrome, polyarthralgia, inflammatory myopathy, esophageal\\nhypomotility, and pulmonary dysfunction are common. Diagnosis is by the combination of\\nclinical features, antibodies to ribonucleoprotein, and absence of antibodies specific for other\\nautoimmune diseases.

Clinical manifestations of specific vasculitic\\ndisorders are diverse and depend on the size of the involved vessels and the organs affected by\\nischemia.\\nEtiology\\nVasculitis may be primary or secondary. Primary vasculitis results from an inflammatory response that\\ntargets the vessel walls and has no known cause. Secondary vasculitis may be triggered by an infection,\\na drug, or a toxin or may occur as part of another inflammatory disorder or cancer.\\nPathophysiology\\nHistologic description of an affected vessel should include the following:\\n• A description of vessel wall damage\\n• The nature of the inflammatory infiltrate in the vessel wall (eg, granulomatous, nongranulomatous,\\nleukocytoclastic vasculitis)\\n• A description of healing responses (eg, intimal hypertrophy, fibrosis)\\nCertain features (eg, predominant inflammatory cells, location of inflammation) suggest particular\\nvasculitic processes and may aid in the diagnosis (see\\nTable 34-1).

Treatment consists of the following:\\n• Corticosteroids: High-dose corticosteroids (also called pulse corticosteroids) are often prescribed.\\nMethylprednisolone 15 mg/kg or 1 g IV once/day for 3 days may be used. Oral prednisone is given\\nconcurrently. A dose of 1 mg/kg once/day is given for about 4 wk until patients improve. The dose is\\nthen tapered slowly, as tolerated, usually by 10 mg every week to 40 mg/day, by 5 mg every 2 wk to 20\\nmg/day, by 2.5 mg every 2 wk to 10 mg/day, and by 1 mg every month from there on until the drug is\\nstopped. Changes in this tapering schedule may be necessary if the patient fails to improve or relapses.\\n• Cyclophosphamide: A dose of 2 mg/kg po once/day is usually recommended for at least 3 mo or until\\nremission occurs. The WBC count must be closely monitored, and the dose must be adjusted to avoid\\nleukopenia. (WBC count should be maintained at > 3500/μL.) If patients cannot tolerate oral\\ncyclophosphamide, are unlikely to take oral drugs as directed, or have a high risk of bladder cancer, IV\\ncyclophosphamide may be used.

The ulcers are round or oval, 2 to 10 mm in\", 'diameter, and shallow or deep with a central yellowish necrotic center; they can occur anywhere in the\\noral cavity, often in clusters. Ulcers last 1 to 2 wk. Similar ulcers occur on the penis and scrotum, on the\\nvulva where they are painful, or in the vagina where they may cause little or no pain.\\nCutaneous lesions are common and may include acneiform lesions, nodules, erythema nodosum,\\nsuperficial thrombophlebitis, pyoderma gangrenosum-type lesions, and palpable purpura.\\nPathergy (an erythematous papular or pustular response to local skin injury) is defined as a papule > 2\\nmm that appears 24 to 48 h after oblique insertion of a 20- to 25-gauge needle into the skin.

Typically, the upper and lower respiratory tract and the kidneys are affected,\\nbut any organ may be. Symptoms vary depending on the organs and systems affected. Patients\\nmay present with upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms (eg, recurrent nasal discharge or\\nepistaxis, cough), followed by hypertension and edema, or with symptoms reflecting multiorgan\\ninvolvement. Diagnosis usually requires biopsy. Treatment is with corticosteroids plus an\\nimmunosuppressant. Remission is usually possible, although relapses are common.\\nWegener's granulomatosis occurs in about 1/25,000 people; it is most common among whites but can\\noccur in all ethnic groups and at any age. Mean age at onset is 40.\\nThe cause is unknown, although immunologic mechanisms play a role. Most patients with active\\ngeneralized disease have antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA).\\nPathophysiology\\nCharacteristically, granulomas form with histiocytic epithelioid cells and often with giant cells. Plasma\\ncells, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils are present. Inflammation affects tissues as well as\", 'vessels; vasculitis may be a small or large component of the disease. Micronecrosis, usually with\\nneutrophils (microabscesses), occurs early. Micronecrosis progresses to macronecrosis. A central area of\\nnecrosis (called geographic necrosis) is rimmed by lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages, and giant\\ncells. A zone of fibroblastic proliferation with palisading histiocytes may surround the area.\\nNonspecific chronic inflammation and tissue necrosis occurs in the nose. The lungs are most likely to\\ndisplay the full spectrum of histopathologic abnormalities. In the kidneys, the most common finding is a\\nproliferative crescentic focal glomerulonephritis with necrosis and thrombosis of individual loops or larger\\nsegments of the glomerulus. Vasculitic lesions and disseminated granulomas occur only occasionally.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nOnset may be insidious or acute; the full spectrum of the disease may take years to evolve. Some\\npatients present initially with upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms; at some point later, the kidneys\\nare affected. In other patients, onset of systemic manifestations is relatively acute; several organs and\\nsystems, such as the upper respiratory tract, peripheral nervous system (causing mononeuritis multiplex),\\nkidneys (causing glomerulonephritis), and lower respiratory tract (causing hemorrhage, lung nodules,\\ncavities, or a combination), are simultaneously affected.\\n• Upper respiratory tract: Sinus pain, serosanguineous or purulent discharge, and epistaxis may occur.\\nThe mucosa appears granular (like cobblestones) and is friable; ulcers, thick dark crusts, and septal\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition\\nChapter 34.

Subglottic stenosis may\\ndevelop, causing symptoms such as pain in the larynx, hoarseness, dyspnea, wheezing, and stridor.\\n• Ears: Otitis, sensorineural hearing loss, vertigo, and chondritis may occur. The middle ear, inner ear,\\nand mastoids are often affected.\\n• Eyes: Eyes may appear red and swollen. Nasolacrimal duct inflammation and obstruction may affect the\\neye; conjunctivitis, scleritis, uveitis, or retinal vasculitis may also occur. Inflammatory infiltrates in the\\nretro-orbital space (orbital pseudotumor) can cause proptosis, compression of the optic nerve, and\\nblindness.

Joint Disorders\\nIntroduction\\nJoint disorders may be inflammatory (RA, spondyloarthropathies, crystal-induced arthritis) or relatively\\nless inflammatory (osteoarthritis, neurogenic arthropathy). Crystal-induced arthritis and infectious arthritis\\nare discussed elsewhere in THE MANUAL.\\nRheumatoid Arthritis\\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease that primarily involves the\\njoints. RA causes damage mediated by cytokines, chemokines, and metalloproteases.\\nCharacteristically, peripheral joints (eg, wrists, metacarpophalangeal joints) are symmetrically\\ninflamed, leading to progressive destruction of articular structures, usually accompanied by\\nsystemic symptoms. Diagnosis is based on specific clinical, laboratory, and imaging features.\\nTreatment involves drugs, physical measures, and sometimes surgery. Disease-modifying\\nantirheumatic drugs help control symptoms and slow disease progression.\\nRA affects about 1% of the population. Women are affected 2 to 3 times more often than men. Onset may\\nbe at any age, most often between 35 yr and 50 yr, but can be during childhood (see Juvenile Idiopathic\\nArthritis on p. 339) or old age.\\nEtiology\\nAlthough RA involves autoimmune reactions, the precise cause is unknown; many factors may contribute.\\nA genetic predisposition has been identified and, in white populations, localized to a shared epitope in the\\nHLA-DR β1 locus of class II histocompatibility antigens. Unknown environmental factors (eg, viral\\ninfections) are thought to play a role.\\nPathophysiology\\nProminent immunologic abnormalities include immune complexes produced by synovial lining cells and in\\ninflamed blood vessels. Plasma cells produce antibodies (eg, rheumatoid factor [RF]) that contribute to\\nthese complexes, but destructive arthritis can occur in the absence of RF. Macrophages also migrate to\\ndiseased synovium in early disease; increased macrophage-derived lining cells are prominent along with\\nvessel inflammation. Lymphocytes that infiltrate the synovial tissue are primarily CD4+ T cells.\\nMacrophages and lymphocytes produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (eg, tumor necrosis', 'factors [TNF], granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF], various ILs, interferon-γ) in\\nthe synovium. Release of inflammatory mediators probably contributes to the systemic and joint\\nmanifestations of RA.\\nIn chronically affected joints, the normally thin synovium thickens and develops many villous folds. The\\nsynovial lining cells produce various materials, including collagenase and stromelysin, which contribute to\\ncartilage destruction, and IL-1 and TNF-α, which stimulate cartilage destruction, osteoclast-mediated\\nbone absorption, synovial inflammation, and prostaglandins (which potentiate inflammation). Fibrin\\ndeposition, fibrosis, and necrosis are also present. Hyperplastic synovial tissue (pannus) releases these\\ninflammatory mediators, which erode cartilage, subchondral bone, articular capsule, and ligaments. PMNs\\non average make up about 60% of WBCs in the synovial fluid.\\nRheumatoid nodules develop in about 30% of patients with RA. They are granulomas consisting of a\\ncentral necrotic area surrounded by palisaded histiocytic macrophages, all enveloped by lymphocytes,\\nplasma cells, and fibroblasts. Nodules and vasculitis can also develop in visceral organs.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nOnset is usually insidious, often beginning with systemic and joint symptoms. Systemic symptoms include\\nearly morning stiffness of affected joints, generalized afternoon fatigue and malaise, anorexia, generalized\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition\\nChapter 35.

Joint symptoms include pain, swelling, and stiffness.\\nThe disease progresses most rapidly during the first 6 yr, particularly the first year; 80% of patients\\ndevelop some permanent joint abnormalities within 10 yr. The course is unpredictable in individual\\npatients.\\nJoint symptoms are characteristically symmetric. Typically, stiffness lasts > 60 min after rising in the\\nmorning but may occur after any prolonged inactivity. Involved joints become tender, with erythema,\\nwarmth, swelling, and limitation of motion. The joints involved include the following:\\n• Wrists and the index and middle metacarpophalangeal joints (most commonly involved)\\n• Proximal interphalangeal joints\\n• Metatarsophalangeal joints\\n• Shoulders\\n• Elbows\\n• Hips\\n• Knees\\n• Ankles\\nHowever, virtually any joint except uncommonly the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints may be involved.\\nThe axial skeleton is rarely involved except for the upper cervical spine. Synovial thickening is detectable.\\nJoints are often held in flexion to minimize pain, which results from joint capsular distention.\\nFixed deformities, particularly flexion contractures, may develop rapidly; ulnar deviation of the fingers with\\nan ulnar slippage of the extensor tendons off the metacarpophalangeal joints is typical, as are swan-neck\\nand boutonniere deformities (see\\nFig. 43-2 on p. 387). Joint instability can also occur. Carpal tunnel syndrome can result from wrist\\nsynovitis compressing the median nerve. Popliteal (Baker's) cysts can develop, causing calf swelling and\\ntenderness suggestive of deep venous thrombosis.\\nExtra-articular manifestations: Subcutaneous rheumatoid nodules are not usually an early sign but\\neventually develop in up to 30% of patients, usually at sites of pressure and chronic irritation (eg, the\\nextensor surface of the forearm, metacarpophalangeal joints, occiput). Visceral nodules, usually\\nasymptomatic, are common in severe RA. Other extra-articular signs include vasculitis causing leg ulcers\\nor mononeuritis multiplex, pleural or pericardial effusions, pulmonary nodules, pulmonary infiltrates or\", \"fibrosis, pericarditis, myocarditis, lymphadenopathy, Felty's syndrome, Sjogren's syndrome, scleromalacia,\\nand episcleritis.

Low RF titers can also occur in 3% of the general population and 20% of the elderly. An RF titer\\nmeasured by latex agglutination of > 1:80 or a positive anti-CCP test supports the diagnosis of RA.\\nAnti-CCP antibodies have high specificity (90%) and sensitivity (96%) for RA and, like RF, predict a worse\\nprognosis.\\nX-rays show only soft-tissue swelling during the first months of disease. Subsequently, periarticular\\nosteoporosis, joint space (articular cartilage) narrowing, and marginal erosions may become visible.\\nErosions often develop within the first year but may occur any time. MRI seems to be more sensitive and\\ndetects earlier articular inflammation and erosions. In addition, abnormal subchondral bone signals (eg,\\nbone marrow lesions, bone marrow edema) around the knee suggest progressive disease.\\nIf RA is diagnosed, additional tests help detect complications and unexpected abnormalities. CBC with\\ndifferential should be obtained. A normochromic (or slightly hypochromic)-normocytic anemia occurs in\\n80%; Hb is usually > 10 g/dL. If Hb is ≤ 10 g/dL, superimposed iron deficiency or other causes of anemia\\nshould be considered. Neutropenia occurs in 1 to 2% of cases, often with splenomegaly (Felty's\\nsyndrome). Acute-phase reactants (eg, thrombocytosis, elevated ESR, elevated C-reactive protein) reflect\", 'disease activity. A mild polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia often occurs. ESR is elevated in 90% of\\npatients with active disease.\\nSynovial fluid examination is necessary with any new-onset effusion to rule out other disorders and\\ndifferentiate RA from other inflammatory arthritides (eg, septic and crystal-induced arthritis). In RA, during\\nactive joint inflammation, synovial fluid is turbid, yellow, and sterile, with reduced viscosity and usually\\n10,000 to 50,000 WBCs/μL; PMNs typically predominate, but > 50% may be lymphocytes and other\\nmononuclear cells.

Molded shoes may be needed for\\nsevere deformities. Self-help devices enable many patients with debilitating RA to perform activities of\\ndaily living.\\nExercise should proceed as tolerated. During acute inflammation, passive range-of-motion exercise helps\\nprevent flexion contractures. Heat therapy can be helpful. Range-of-motion exercises done in warm water\\nare helpful because heat improves muscle function by reducing stiffness and muscle spasm. However,\\ncontractures can be prevented and muscle strength can be restored more successfully after inflammation\\nbegins to subside; active exercise (including walking and specific exercises for involved joints) to restore\\nmuscle mass and preserve range of joint motion should not be fatiguing. Flexion contractures may require\\nintensive exercise, casting, or immobilization (eg, splinting) in progressively more stretched-open\\npositions. Paraffin baths can warm digits and facilitate finger exercise. Massage by trained therapists,\\ntraction, and deep heat treatment with diathermy or ultrasonography may be useful.\\nSurgery: Surgery must always be considered in terms of the total disease and patient expectations.

Thumb fusions may provide stability for pinch. Neck fusion may be needed for C1-2 subluxation\\nwith severe pain or potential for spinal cord compression. Arthroscopic or open synovectomy can relieve\\njoint inflammation but only temporarily unless disease activity can be controlled.\\nDrugs for RA\\nThe goal is to reduce inflammation as a means of preventing erosions and progressive deformity.', 'The goal is to reduce inflammation as a means of preventing erosions and progressive deformity.\\nDisease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are used early, often in combination. Other drug\\nclasses, including biologic agents, TNF-α antagonists, and IL-1 receptor antagonists, seem to slow the\\nprogression of RA. NSAIDs are of some help for the pain of RA but do not prevent erosions or disease\\nprogression. Sometimes low-dose systemic corticosteroids (prednisone < 10 mg daily) are added to\\ncontrol severe polyarticular symptoms, usually with the objective of replacement with a DMARD. Intra-\\narticular depot corticosteroids can control severe monarticular or even oligoarticular symptoms. The\\noptimal combinations of drugs are not yet clear. However, some data suggest that certain combinations of\\ndrugs from different classes (eg, methotrexate plus other DMARDs, a rapidly tapered corticosteroid plus a\\nDMARD, methotrexate plus a TNF-α antagonist or an IL-1 receptor antagonist, a TNF-α antagonist or an\\nIL-1 receptor antagonist plus a DMARD) are more effective than using DMARDs alone sequentially or in\\ncombination.\\nNSAIDs: Aspirin is no longer used for RA, as effective doses are often toxic. Only one NSAID should be\\ngiven at a time (see\\nTable 35-2), although patients may also take aspirin at ≤ 325 mg/day for its antiplatelet cardioprotective\\neffect. Because the maximal response for NSAIDs can take up to 2 wk, doses should be increased no\\nmore frequently than this. Doses of drugs with flexible dosing can be increased until response is maximal\\nor maximum dosage is reached. All NSAIDs treat the symptoms of RA and decrease inflammation but do\\nnot alter the course of the disease.\\nNSAIDs inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes and thus decrease production of prostaglandins. Some\\nprostaglandins under COX-1 control have important effects in\\n[Table 35-2. NSAID Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis]\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition\\nChapter 35.

Other\\nprostaglandins are induced by inflammation and are produced by COX-2. Selective COX-2 inhibitors, also\\ncalled coxibs (eg, celecoxib), seem to have efficacy comparable to nonselective NSAIDs and are less\\nlikely to cause GI toxicity; however, they do not seem less likely to cause renal toxicity.\\nNSAIDs other than coxibs should be avoided in patients with previous peptic ulcer disease or dyspepsia.\\nOther possible adverse effects of all NSAIDs include headache, confusion and other CNS symptoms,\\nincreased BP, worsening of hypertension, edema, and decreased platelet function. The effect of NSAIDs\\non cardiovascular risk is still unclear. Creatinine levels can rise reversibly because of inhibited renal\\nprostaglandins; less frequently, interstitial nephritis can occur. Patients with urticaria, rhinitis, or asthma\\nfrom aspirin can have the same problems with these other NSAIDs.\\nTraditional DMARDs: (See\\nTable 35-3 for specific dosage information and adverse effects of other drugs used to treat RA.)\\nThese drugs seem to slow the progression of RA and are indicated in nearly all patients with RA. They\\ndiffer from each other chemically and pharmacologically. Many take weeks or months to have an effect.\\nAbout two thirds of patients improve overall, but complete remissions are uncommon. Many result in\\nevidence of decreased damage on imaging studies, presumably reflecting decreased disease activity.\\nThey have minimal immediate analgesic effects, so NSAIDs or low-dose corticosteroids must often be\\ncontinued. Patients should be fully apprised of the risks of DMARDs and monitored carefully for evidence\\nof toxicity.\\nCombinations of DMARDs may be more effective than single drugs. For example, hydroxychloroquine,\\nsulfasalazine, and methotrexate together are more effective than methotrexate alone or the other two\\ntogether. Also, combining a DMARD with another drug, such as methotrexate plus a TNF-α antagonist or\\nan IL-1 receptor antagonist or a rapidly tapered corticosteroid, may be more effective than using DMARDs', 'alone.\\nMethotrexate is a folate antagonist with immunosuppressive effects at high dose. It is anti-inflammatory\\nat doses used in RA. It is very effective and has a relatively rapid onset (clinical benefit often within 3 to 4\\nwk). Methotrexate should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with hepatic dysfunction or renal\\nfailure. Alcohol should be avoided. Supplemental folate, 1 mg po once/day, reduces the likelihood of\\nadverse effects. CBC, AST, ALT, and albumin and creatinine levels should be determined about every 8\\nwk. Rarely, a liver biopsy is needed if liver function test findings are persistently twice the upper limit of\\nnormal or more and the patient needs to continue to use methotrexate. Severe relapses of arthritis can\\noccur after withdrawal of methotrexate. Paradoxically, rheumatoid nodules may enlarge with methotrexate\\ntherapy.\\nHydroxychloroquine can also control symptoms of mild RA. Funduscopic examination should be done\\nand visual fields should be assessed before and every 12 mo during treatment. The drug should be\\nstopped if no improvement occurs after 9 mo.\\nSulfasalazine can alleviate symptoms and slow development of joint damage. It is usually given as\\nenteric-coated tablets. Benefit should occur within 3 mo. Enteric coating or dose reduction may increase\\ntolerability. CBCs should be obtained after 1 to 2 wk and then about every 12 wk during therapy. AST and\\nALT should be obtained at about 6-mo intervals and whenever the dose is increased.\\nLeflunomide interferes with an enzyme involved with pyrimidine metabolism. It is about as effective as\\nmethotrexate but is less likely to suppress bone marrow, cause abnormal liver function, or cause\\npneumonitis.\\nParenteral gold compounds are not commonly used anymore.\\nCorticosteroids: Systemic corticosteroids decrease inflammation and other symptoms more rapidly and\\nto a greater degree than other drugs. They also seem to slow bone erosion. However, they do not\\nprevent joint destruction, and their clinical benefit often diminishes with time. Furthermore, rebound often\\nfollows the withdrawal of corticosteroids in active disease.

Triamcinolone hexacetonide may suppress inflammation for the longest time.\\nTriamcinolone acetonide and methylprednisolone acetate are also effective. No single joint should be\\ninjected with a corticosteroid more than 3 to 4 times a year, as too-frequent injections may accelerate joint\\ndestruction (although there are no specific data from humans to support this effect).

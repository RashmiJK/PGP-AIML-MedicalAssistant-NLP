            "4. Hormonal Imbalance: Hormonal changes, such as those caused by pregnancy, menopause, or thyroid problems, can cause hair loss.\n",

            "3. Immunotherapy: Injections of certain proteins that can help stimulate hair growth by altering the immune response.\n",
            "4. Nutritional Supplements: Supplements containing iron, zinc, biotin, and other essential nutrients can help promote hair growth.\n",

            "2. Stress: Physical or emotional stress can cause hair loss.\n",
            "3. Nutritional Deficiencies: Lack of certain nutrients, such as iron, zinc, or biotin, can lead to hair loss.\n",
            "4. Hormonal Imbalance: Hormonal changes, such as those caused by pregnancy, menopause, or thyroid problems, can cause hair loss.\n",
            "5. Medications: Certain medications, such as chemotherapy drugs, can cause hair loss.\n",
            "\n",
            "Treatments:\n",
            "1. Minoxidil: A topical medication that can help stimulate hair growth and slow down hair loss.\n",
            "2. Corticosteroids: Prescription medications that can help reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system to promote hair growth.\n",
            "3. Immunotherapy: Injections of certain proteins that can help stimulate hair growth by altering the immune response.\n",
            "4. Hair Transplant Surgery: A surgical procedure in which healthy hair follicles are transplanted to bald areas of the scalp.\n",
            "5. Nutritional Therapy: Eating a balanced diet rich in essential nutrients can help promote hair growth.\n",
            "6. Stress Reduction Techniques: Practicing stress reduction techniques, such as meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises, can help reduce stress and promote hair growth.\n",
            "7. Hormonal Balance: Treating underlying hormonal imbalances, such as thyroid problems or menopause, can help promote hair growth.\n",

For mild to moderate brain injuries, rest, medication for pain and swelling, and rehabilitation therapies such as physical, occupational, and speech therapy may be recommended. For more severe injuries, treatments may include surgery to remove hematomas or repair skull fractures, and intensive care to manage symptoms such as seizures, infections, or breathing problems. Rehabilitation is also an important part of treatment for brain injuries, regardless of severity. It can help individuals regain skills and improve function. Additionally, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms such as seizures, depression, or difficulty with attention or memory.

        "1.  **Chunking**: Divide the PDF document into smaller, manageable text segments (chunks). We will create two sets of chunks with different sizes (490 and 245 tokens) to explore the impact of chunk size on retrieval.\n",
        "2.  **Vectorization**: Convert these text chunks into numerical representations called embeddings using the pre-trained GTE-Large embedding model.\n",

              "\"\\n\\nVitamin A is an essential nutrient that plays a crucial role in maintaining good vision, a healthy immune system, and normal growth and development. However, too much vitamin A can be harmful, especially for pregnant women and young children.\\n\\nThe symptoms of vitamin A overdose, also known as hypervitaminosis A, can vary depending on the severity of the overdose. Here are some common side effects of vitamin A overdose:\\n\\n1. Nausea and vomiting: Vitamin A overdose can cause stomach discomfort, including nausea and vomiting.\\n2. Dizziness and headache: Overdosing on vitamin A can lead to dizziness, lightheadedness, and headaches.\\n3. Skin irritation: Vitamin A overdose can cause skin irritation, including itching, dryness, and peeling.\\n4. Liver damage: Severe vitamin A overdose can cause liver damage, which can lead to jaundice, yellowing of the skin and eyes, and other symptoms.\\n5. Birth defects: Pregnant women who consume too much vitamin A can increase the risk of birth defects, including cleft palate and other structural abnormalities.\\n6. Bone abnormalities: Long-term vitamin A overdose can lead to bone abnormalities, including thinning and weakening of the bones.\\n7. Hair loss: Vitamin A overdose can cause hair loss, especially in children.\\n8. Vision problems: In rare cases, vitamin A overdose can cause vision problems, including blurred vision, night blindness, and other eye-related symptoms.\\n\\nIt's important to note that the symptoms of vitamin A overdose can vary widely depending on the individual's age, health status, and the amount of vitamin A consumed. If you suspect that you or someone you know has overdosed on vitamin A, it's important to seek medical attention right away. Your healthcare provider can evaluate your symptoms and determine the best course of treatment.\\n\\nTo avoid vitamin A overdose, it's important to avoid taking more than the recommended daily intake of vitamin A. The recommended daily intake of vitamin A for adults is 700-900 micrograms per day, while pregnant women should not exceed 770 micrograms per day. Children should also avoid taking high doses of vitamin A, as they are more susceptible to the negative effects of the vitamin.\\n\\nIt's also important to be aware of the sources of vitamin A in your diet. Foods that are rich in vitamin A include liver, fish liver oil, egg yolks, and fortified dairy products. Dark green and yellow vegetables, such as carrots, sweet potatoes, and spinach, also contain vitamin A, but in smaller amounts. If you are concerned about getting too much vitamin A from your diet, talk to your healthcare provider about your concerns. They can help you determine the right amount of vitamin A for your individual needs.\""

Vancomycin should be added if resistant staphylococci or enterococci are suspected. If there is an abdominal source, a drug effective against anaerobes should be included. Culture and sensitivity results should be used to change the antibiotic regimen accordingly. Antibiotics should be continued for at least 5 days after shock resolves and evidence of infection subsides. Abscesses must be drained, and necrotic tissues must be surgically excised. Normalization of blood glucose improves outcome in critically ill patients, and a continuous IV insulin infusion is titrated to maintain glucose between 80 to 110 mg/dL.'"

In the first few days after the injury, maintaining adequate brain perfusion and oxygenation and preventing complications of altered sensorium are important. Subsequently, many patients require rehabilitation. Supportive care should include preventing systemic complications due to immobilization, providing good nutrition, and preventing pressure ulcers. A team approach that combines physical, occupational, and speech therapy, skill-building activities, and counseling may be required for patients whose coma exceeds 24 hours. Rehabilitation services should be planned early. There is no specific treatment for the brain injury itself.'"

They should also seek medical care at once if an odor emanates from within the cast or if a fever develops. Immobilization with a cast is helpful for fractures, but prolonged immobilization can cause complications such as stiffness, contractures, and muscle atrophy. Early mobilization, which involves resuming active motion within the first few days or weeks, may minimize these complications and accelerate functional recovery. In the field, the affected area should be rewarmed rapidly by immersing it in water that is tolerably warm to the touch, and the patient should be given analgesics if available. Once in the hospital, the patient should be encouraged to move the affected part and parenteral analgesics may be used during rewarming.\""

In severe cases, long-acting oral tetracyclines in combination with potent topical corticosteroids may be used for scarring alopecia. The cause of alopecia areata is believed to be an autoimmune disorder, and it is important to rule out other underlying disorders through proper evaluation.'"
